ÂæS
Üá√¢‚Ç¨≈ìAnd you can be Death itself to him. Now!√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

Death entered, his feet clicking across the stage.

COWER NOW, BRIEF MORTALS, he said, FOR I AM DEATH, √¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢GAINST WHOM NO√¢‚Ç¨¬¶NO√¢‚Ç¨¬¶√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢GAINST WHOM√¢‚Ç¨¬¶

He hesitated. He hesitated, for the very first time in the eternity of his existence.

For although the Death of the Discworld was used to dealing with people by the million, at the same time every death was intimate and personal.

Death was seldom seen except by those of an occult persuasion and his clients themselves. The reason that no one else saw him was that the human brain is clever enough to edit sights too horrible for it to cope with, but the problem here was that several hundred people were in fact expecting to see Death at this point, and were therefore seeing him.

Death turned slowly and stared back at hundreds of watching eyes.

Even in the grip of the truth Tomjon recognized a fellow actor in distress, and fought for mastery of his lips.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ì√¢‚Ç¨Àú√¢‚Ç¨¬¶lock will hold√¢‚Ç¨¬¶√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ he whispered, through teeth fixed in a grimace.

Death gave him a manic grin of stagefright.

WHAT? he whispered, in a voice like an anvil being hit with a small lead hammer.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ì√¢‚Ç¨Àú√¢‚Ç¨¬¶lock will hold, nor fasten√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢d portal√¢‚Ç¨¬¶,√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ said Tomjon encouragingly.

√¢‚Ç¨¬¶LOCK WILL HOLD NOR FASTEN√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢D PORTAL√¢‚Ç¨¬¶UH√¢‚Ç¨¬¶repeated Death desperately, watching his lips.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ì√¢‚Ç¨Àú√¢‚Ç¨¬¶bar!√¢‚Ç¨¬¶√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

BAR.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìNo, I cannot do it!√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ said Wimsloe. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìI will be seen! Down there in the hall, someone watches!√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìThere is no one!√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìI feel the stare!√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìDithering idiot! Must I put it in for you? See, his foot is upon the top stair!√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

Wimsloe√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s face contorted with fear and uncertainty. He drew back his hand.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìNo!√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

The scream came from the audience. The duke was half-risen from his seat, his tortured knuckles at his mouth. As they watched he lurched forward between the shocked people.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìNo! I did not do it! It was not like that! You cannot say it was like that! You were not there!√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ He stared at the upturned faces around him, and sagged.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìNor was I,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ he giggled. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìI was asleep at the time, you know. I remember it quite well. There was blood on the counterpane, there was blood on the floor, I could not wash off the blood, but these are not proper subjects for the inquiry. I cannot allow the discussion of national security. It was just a dream, and when I awoke, he√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢d be alive tomorrow. And tomorrow it wouldn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t have happened because it was not done. And tomorrow you can say I did not know. And tomorrow you can say I had no recollection. What a noise he made in falling! Enough to wake the dead√¢‚Ç¨¬¶who would have thought he had so much blood in him?√¢‚Ç¨¬¶√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ By now he had climbed onto the stage, and grinned brightly at the assembled company.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìI hope that sorts it all out,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ he said. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìHa. Ha.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

In the silence that followed Tomjon opened his mouth to utter something suitable, something soothing, and found that there was nothing he could say.

But another personality stepped into him, took over his lips, and spoke thusly:

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìWith my own bloody dagger, you bastard! I know it was you! I saw you at the top of the stairs, sucking your thumb! I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢d kill you now, except for the thought of having to spend eternity listening to your whining. I, Verence, formerly King of√¢‚Ç¨‚Äù√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìWhat testimony is this?√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ said the duchess. She stood in front of the stage, with half a dozen soldiers beside her.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìThese are just slanders,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ she added. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìAnd treason to boot. The rantings of mad players.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìI was bloody King of Lancre!√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ shouted Tomjon.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìIn which case you are the alleged victim,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ said the duchess calmly. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìAnd unable to speak for the prosecution. It is against all precedent.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

Tomjon√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s body turned toward Death.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìYou were there! You saw it all!√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

I SUSPECT I WOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED AN APPROPRIATE WITNESS.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìTherefore there is no proof, and where there is no proof there is no crime,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ said the duchess. She motioned the soldiers forward.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìSo much for your experiment,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ she said to her husband. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìI think my way is better.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

She looked around the stage, and found the witches.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìArrest them,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ she said.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìNo,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ said the Fool, stepping out of the wings.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìWhat did you say?√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìI saw it all,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ said the Fool, simply. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìI was in the Great Hall that night. You killed the king, my lord.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìI did not!√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ screamed the duke. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìYou were not there! I did not see you there! I order you not to be there!√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìYou did not dare say this before,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ said Lady Felmet.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìYes, lady. But I must say it now.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

The duke focused unsteadily on him.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìYou swore loyalty unto death, my Fool,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ he hissed.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìYes, my lord. I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m sorry.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìYou√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re dead.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

The duke snatched a dagger from Wimsloe√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s unresisting hand, darted forward, and plunged it to the hilt into the Fool√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s heart. Magrat screamed.

The Fool rocked back and forth unsteadily.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìThank goodness that√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s over,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ he said, as Magrat pushed her way through the actors and clasped him to what could charitably be called her bosom. It struck the Fool that he had never looked a bosom squarely in the face, at least since he was a baby, and it was particularly cruel of the world to save the experience until after he was dead.

He gently moved one of Magrat√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s arms and pulled the despicable horned cowl from his head, and tossed it as far as possible. He didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t have to be a Fool anymore or, he realized, bother about vows or anything. What with bosoms as well, death seemed to be an improvement.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìI didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t do it,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ said the duke.

No pain, thought the Fool. Funny, that. On the other hand, you obviously can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t feel pain when you are dead. It would be wasted.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìYou all saw that I didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t do it,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ said the duke.

Death gave the Fool a puzzled look. Then he reached into the recesses of his robes and pulled out an hourglass. It had bells on it. He gave it a gentle shake, which made them tinkle.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìI gave no orders that any such thing should be done,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ said the duke calmly. His voice came from a long way off, from wherever his mind was now. The company stared at him wordlessly. It wasn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t possible to hate someone like this, only to feel acutely embarrassed about being anywhere near him. Even the Fool felt embarrassed, and he was dead.

Death tapped the hourglass, and then peered at it to see if it had gone wrong.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìYou are all lying,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ said the duke, in tranquil tones. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìTelling lies is naughty.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

He stabbed several of the nearest actors in a dreamy, gentle way, and then held up the blade.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìYou see?√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ he said. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìNo blood! It wasn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t me.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ He looked up at the duchess, towering over him now like a red tsunami over a small fishing village.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìIt was her,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ he said. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìShe did it.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

He stabbed her once or twice, on general principles, and then stabbed himself and let the dagger drop from his fingers.

After a few seconds reflection he said, in a voice far nearer the worlds of sanity, √¢‚Ç¨≈ìYou can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t get me now.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

He turned to Death. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìWill there be a comet?√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ he said. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìThere must be a comet when a prince dies. I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ll go and see, shall I?√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

He wandered away. The audience broke into applause.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìYou√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve got to admit he was real royalty,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ said Nanny Ogg, eventually. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìIt only goes to show, royalty goes eccentric far better than the likes of you and me.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

Death held the hourglass to his skull, his face radiating puzzlement.

Granny Weatherwax picked up the fallen dagger and tested the blade with her finger. It slid into the handle quite easily, with a faint squeaking noise.

She passed it to Nanny.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìThere√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s your magic sword,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ she said.

Magrat looked at it, and then back at the Fool.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìAre you dead or not?√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ she said.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìI must be,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ said the Fool, his voice slightly muffled. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìI think I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m in paradise.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìNo, look, I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m serious.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìI don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t know. But I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢d like to breathe.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìThen you must be alive.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìEveryone√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s alive,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ said Granny. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìIt√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s a trick dagger. Actors probably can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t be trusted with real ones.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìAfter all, they can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t even keep a cauldron clean,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ said Nanny.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìWhether everyone is alive or not is a matter for me,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ said the duchess. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìAs ruler it is my pleasure to decide. Clearly my husband has lost his wits.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ She turned to her soldiers. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìAnd I decree√¢‚Ç¨‚Äù√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìNow!√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ hissed King Verence in Granny√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s ear. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìNow!√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

Granny Weatherwax drew herself up.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìBe silent, woman!√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ she said. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìThe true King of Lancre stands before you!√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

She clapped Tomjon on the shoulder.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìWhat, him?√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìWho, me?√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìRidiculous,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ said the duchess. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìHe√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s a mummer, of sorts.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìShe√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s right, miss,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ said Tomjon, on the edge of panic. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìMy father runs a theater, not a kingdom.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìHe is the true king. We can prove it,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ said Granny.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìOh, no,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ said the duchess. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìWe√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re not having that. There√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s no mysterious returned heirs in this kingdom. Guards√¢‚Ç¨‚Äùtake him.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

Granny Weatherwax held up a hand. The soldiers lurched from foot to foot, uncertainly.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìShe√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s a witch, isn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t she?√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ said one of them, tentatively.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìCertainly,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ said the duchess.

The guards shifted uneasily.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìWe seen where they turn people into newts,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ said one.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìAnd then shipwreck them.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìYeah, and alarum the divers.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìYeah.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìWe ought to talk about this. We ought to get extra for witches.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìShe could do anything to us, look. She could be a drabe, even.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìDon√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t be foolish,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ said the duchess. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìWitches don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t do that sort of thing. They√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re just stories to frighten people.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

The guard shook his head.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìIt looked pretty convincing to me.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìOf course it did, it was meant√¢‚Ç¨‚Äù√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ the duchess began. She sighed, and snatched a spear out of the guard√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s hand.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìI√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ll show you the power of these witches,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ she said, and hurled it at Granny√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s face.

Granny moved her hand across at snakebite speed and caught the spear just behind the head.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìSo,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ she said, √¢‚Ç¨≈ìand it comes to this, does it?√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìYou don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t frighten me, wyrd sisters,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ said the duchess.

Granny stared her in the eye for a few seconds. She gave a grunt of surprise.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìYou√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re right,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ she said. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìWe really don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t, do we√¢‚Ç¨¬¶√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìDo you think I haven√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t studied you? Your witchcraft is all artifice and illusion, to amaze weak minds. It holds no fears for me. Do your worst.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

Granny studied her for a while.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìMy worst?√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ she said, eventually. Magrat and Nanny Ogg shuffled gently out of her way.

The duchess laughed.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìYou√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re clever,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ she said. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìI√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ll grant you that much. And quick. Come on, hag. Bring on your toads and demons, I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ll√¢‚Ç¨¬¶√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

She stopped, her mouth opening and shutting a bit without any words emerging. Her lips drew back in a rictus of terror, her eyes looked beyond Granny, beyond the world, toward something else. One knuckled hand flew to her mouth and she made a little whimpering noise. She froze, like a rabbit that has just seen a stoat and knows, without any doubt, that it is the last stoat that it will ever see.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìWhat have you done to her?√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ said Magrat, the first to dare to speak. Granny smirked.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìHeadology,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ said Granny, and smirked. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìYou don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t need any Black Aliss magic for it.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìYes, but what have you done?√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìNo one becomes like she is without building walls inside their head,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ she said. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìI√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve just knocked them down. Every scream. Every plea. Every pang of guilt. Every twinge of conscience. All at once. There√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s a little trick to it.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

She gave Magrat a condescending smile. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìI√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ll show you one day, if you like.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

Magrat thought about it. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìIt√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s horrible,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ she said.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìNonsense,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ Granny smiled terribly. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìEveryone wants to know their true self. Now, she does.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìSometimes, you have to be kind to be cruel,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ said Nanny Ogg approvingly.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìI think it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s probably the worst thing that could happen to anyone,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ said Magrat, as the duchess swayed backward and forward.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìFor goodness√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ sake use your imagination, girl,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ said Granny. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìThere are far worse things. Needles under the fingernails, for one. Stuff with pliers.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìRed-hot knives up the jacksie,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ said Nanny Ogg. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìHandle first, too, so you cut your fingers trying to pull them out√¢‚Ç¨‚Äù√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìThis is simply the worst that I can do,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ said Granny Weatherwax primly. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìIt√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s all right and proper, too. A witch should act like that, you know. There√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s no need for any dramatic stuff. Most magic goes on in the head. It√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s headology. Now, if you√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢d√¢‚Ç¨‚Äù√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

A noise like a gas leak escaped from the duchess√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s lips. Her head jerked back suddenly. She opened her eyes, blinked, and focused on Granny. Sheer hatred suffused her features.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìGuards!√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ she said. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìI told you to take them!√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

Granny√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s jaw sagged. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìWhat?√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ she said. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìBut√¢‚Ç¨‚Äùbut I showed you your true self√¢‚Ç¨¬¶√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìI√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m supposed to be upset by that, am I?√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ As the soldiers sheepishly grabbed Granny√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s arms the duchess pressed her face close to Granny√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s, her tremendous eyebrows a V of triumphant hatred. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìI√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m supposed to grovel on the floor, is that it? Well, old woman, I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve seen exactly what I am, do you understand, and I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m proud of it! I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢d do it all again, only hotter and longer! I enjoyed it, and I did it because I wanted to!√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

She thumped the vast expanse of her chest.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìYou gawping idiots!√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ she said. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìYou√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re so weak. You really think that people are basically decent underneath, don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t you?√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

The crowd on the stage backed away from the sheer force of her exultation.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìWell, I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve looked underneath,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ said the duchess. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìI know what drives people. It√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s fear. Sheer, deep-down fear. There√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s not one of you who doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t fear me, I can make you widdle your drawers out of terror, and now I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m going to take√¢‚Ç¨‚Äù√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

At this point Nanny Ogg hit her on the back of the head with the cauldron.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìShe does go on, doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t she?√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ she said conversationally, as the duchess collapsed. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìShe was a bit eccentric, if you ask me.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

There was a long, embarrassed silence.

Granny Weatherwax coughed. Then she treated the soldiers holding her to a bright, friendly smile, and pointed to the mound that was now the duchess.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìTake her away and put her in a cell somewhere,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ she commanded. The men snapped to attention, grabbed the duchess by her arms, and pulled her upright with considerable difficulty.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìGently, mind,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ said Granny.

She rubbed her hands together and turned to Tomjon, who was watching her with his mouth open.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìDepend on it,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ she hissed. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìHere and now, my lad, you don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t have a choice. You√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re the King of Lancre.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìBut I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t know how to be a king!√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìWe all seed you! You had it down just right, including the shouting.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìThat√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s just acting!√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìAct, then. Being a king is, is√¢‚Ç¨‚Äù√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ Granny hesitated, and snapped her fingers at Magrat. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìWhat do you call them things, there√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s always a hundred of them in anything?√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

Magrat looked bewildered. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìDo you mean percents?√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ she said.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìThem,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ agreed Granny. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìMost of the percents in being a king is acting, if you ask me. You ought to be good at it.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

Tomjon looked for help into the wings, where Hwel should have been. The dwarf was in fact there, but he wasn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t paying much attention. He had the script in front of him, and was rewriting furiously.ﬂ
