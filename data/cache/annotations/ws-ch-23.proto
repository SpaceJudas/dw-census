ÍCLancre Castle shook. It wasn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t a violent shaking, but it didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t need to be, the construction of the castle being such that it swayed slightly even in a gentle breeze. A small turret toppled slowly into the depths of the misty canyon.

The Fool lay on his flagstones and shivered in his sleep. He appreciated the honor, if it was an honor, but sleeping in the corridor always made him dream of the Fools√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ Guild, behind whose severe gray walls he had trembled his way through seven years of terrible tuition. The flagstones were slightly softer than the beds there, though.

A few feet away a suit of armor jingled gently. Its pike vibrated in its mailed glove until, swishing through the night air like a swooping bat, it slid down and shattered the flagstone by the Fool√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s ear.

The Fool sat up and realized he was still shivering. So was the floor.

In Lord Felmet√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s room the shaking sent cascades of dust down from the ancient four-poster. He awoke from a dream that a great beast was tramping around the castle, and decided with horror that it might be true.

A portrait of some long-dead king fell off the wall. The duke screamed.

The Fool stumbled in, trying to keep his balance on a floor that was now heaving like the sea, and the duke staggered out of bed and grabbed the little man by his jerkin.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìWhat√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s happening?√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ he hissed. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìIs it an earthquake?√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìWe don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t have them in these parts, my lord,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ said the Fool, and was knocked aside as a chaise longue drifted slowly across the carpet.

The duke dashed to the window, and looked out at the forests in the moonlight. The white-capped trees shook in the still night air.

A slab of plaster crashed onto the floor. Lord Felmet spun around and this time his grip lifted the Fool a foot off the floor.

Among the very many luxuries the duke had dispensed with in his life was that of ignorance. He liked to feel he knew what was going on. The glorious uncertainties of existence held no attraction for him.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìIt√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s the witches, isn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t it?√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ he growled, his left cheek beginning to twitch like a landed fish. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìThey√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re out there, aren√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t they? They√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re putting an Influence on the castle, aren√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t they?√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìMarry, nuncle√¢‚Ç¨‚Äù√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ the Fool began.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìThey run this country, don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t they?√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìNo, my lord, they√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve never√¢‚Ç¨‚Äù√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìWho asked you?√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

The Fool was trembling with fear in perfect antiphase to the castle, so that he was the only thing that now appeared to be standing perfectly still.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìEr, you did, my lord,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ he quavered.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìAre you arguing with me?√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìNo, my lord!√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìI thought so. You√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re in league with them, I suppose?√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìMy lord!√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ said the Fool, really shocked.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìYou√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re all in league, you people!√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ the duke snarled. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìThe whole bunch of you! You√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re nothing but a pack of ringleaders!√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

He flung the Fool aside and thrust the tall windows open, striding out into the freezing night air. He glared out over the sleeping kingdom.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìDo you all hear me?√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ he screamed. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìI am the king!√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

The shaking stopped, catching the duke off-balance. He steadied himself quickly, and brushed the plaster dust off his nightshirt.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìRight, then,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ he said.

But this was worse. Now the forest was listening. The words he spoke vanished into a great vacuum of silence.

There was something out there. He could feel it. It was strong enough to shake the castle, and now it was watching him, listening to him.

The duke backed away, very carefully, fumbling behind him for the window catch. He stepped carefully into the room, shut the windows and hurriedly pulled the curtains across.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìI am the king,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ he repeated, quietly. He looked at the Fool, who felt that something was expected of him.

The man is my lord and master, he thought. I have eaten his salt, or whatever all that business was. They told me at Guild school that a Fool should be faithful to his master until the very end, after all others have deserted him. Good or bad doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t come into it. Every leader needs his Fool. There is only loyalty. That√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s the whole thing. Even if he is clearly three-parts bonkers, I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m his Fool until one of us dies.

To his horror he realized the duke was weeping.

The Fool fumbled in his sleeve and produced a rather soiled red and yellow handkerchief embroidered with bells. The duke took it with an expression of pathetic gratitude and blew his nose. Then he held it away from him and gazed at it with demented suspicion.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìIs this a dagger I see before me?√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ he mumbled.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìUm. No, my lord. It√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s my handkerchief, you see. You can sort of tell the difference if you look closely. It doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t have as many sharp edges.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìGood fool,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ said the duke, vaguely.

Totally mad, the Fool thought. Several bricks short of a bundle. So far around the twist you could use him to open wine bottles.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìKneel beside me, my Fool.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

The Fool did so. The duke laid a soiled bandage on his shoulder.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìAre you loyal, Fool?√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ he said. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìAre you trustworthy?√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìI swore to follow my lord until death,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ said the Fool hoarsely.

The duke pressed his mad face close to the Fool, who looked up into a pair of bloodshot eyes.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìI didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t want to,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ he hissed conspiratorially. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìThey made me do it. I didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t want√¢‚Ç¨‚Äù√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

The door swung open. The duchess filled the doorway. In fact, she was nearly the same shape.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìLeonal!√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ she barked.

The Fool was fascinated by what happened to the duke√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s eyes. The mad red flame vanished, was sucked backward, and was replaced by the hard blue stare he had come to recognize. It didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t mean, he realized, that the duke was any less mad. Even the coldness of his sanity was madness in a way. The duke had a mind that ticked like a clock and, like a clock, it regularly went cuckoo.

Lord Felmet looked up calmly.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìYes, my dear?√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìWhat is the meaning of all this?√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ she demanded.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìWitches, I suspect,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ said Lord Felmet.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìI really don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t think√¢‚Ç¨‚Äù√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ the Fool began. Lady Felmet√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s glare didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t merely silence him, it almost nailed him to the wall.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìThat is clearly apparent,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ she said. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìYou are an idiot.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìA Fool, my lady.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìAs well,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ she added, and turned back to her husband.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìSo,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ she said, smiling grimly. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìStill they defy you?√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

The duke shrugged. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìHow should I fight magic?√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ he said.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìWith words,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ said the Fool, without thinking, and was instantly sorry. They were both staring at him.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìWhat?√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ said the duchess.

The Fool dropped his mandolin in his embarrassment.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìIn√¢‚Ç¨‚Äùin the Guild,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ said the Fool, √¢‚Ç¨≈ìwe learned that words can be more powerful even than magic.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìClown!√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ said the duke. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìWords are just words. Brief syllables. Sticks and stones may break my bones√¢‚Ç¨‚Äù√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ he paused, savoring the thought√¢‚Ç¨‚Äù√¢‚Ç¨≈ìbut words can never hurt me.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìMy lord, there are such words that can,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ said the Fool. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìLair! Usurper! Murderer!√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

The duke jerked back and gripped the arms of the throne, wincing.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìSuch words have no truth,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ said the Fool, hurriedly. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìBut they can spread like fire underground, breaking out to burn√¢‚Ç¨‚Äù√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìIt√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s true! It√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s true!√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ screamed the duke. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìI hear them, all the time!√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ He leaned forward. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìIt√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s the witches!√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ he hissed.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìThen, then, then they can be fought with other words,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ said the Fool. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìWords can fight even witches.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìWhat words?√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ said the duchess, thoughtfully.

The Fool shrugged. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìCrone. Evil eye. Stupid old woman.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

The duchess raised one thick eyebrow.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìYou are not entirely an idiot, are you,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ she said. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìYou refer to rumor.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìJust so, my lady.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ The Fool rolled his eyes. What had he got himself into?

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìIt√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s the witches,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ whispered the duke, to no one in particular. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìWe must tell the world about the witches. They√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re evil. They make it come back, the blood. Even sandpaper doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t work.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩû
