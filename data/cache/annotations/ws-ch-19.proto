ﬂ^Once again the full moon rode the clouds.

Granny Weatherwax milked and fed the goats, banked the fire, put a cloth over the mirror and pulled her broomstick out from behind the door. She went out, locked the back door behind her, and hung the key on its nail in the privy.

This was quite sufficient. Only once, in the entire history of witchery in the Ramtops, had a thief broken into a witch√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s cottage. The witch concerned visited the most terrible punishment on him.

Granny sat on the broom and muttered a few words, but without much conviction. After a further couple of tries she got off, fiddled with the binding, and had another go. There was a suspicion of glitter from one end of the stick, which quickly died away.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìDrat,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ she said, under her breath.

She looked around carefully, in case anyone was watching. In fact it was only a hunting badger who, hearing the thumping of running feet, poked its head out from the bushes and saw Granny hurtling down the path with the broomstick held stiff-armed beside her. At last the magic caught, and she managed to vault clumsily onto it before it trundled into the night sky as gracefully as a duck with one wing missing.

From above the trees came a muffled curse against all dwarfish mechanics.

Most witches preferred to live in isolated cottages with the traditional curly chimneys and weed-grown thatch. Granny Weatherwax approved of this; it was no good being a witch unless you let people know.

Nanny Ogg didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t care much about what people knew and even less for what they thought, and lived in a new, knick-knack crammed cottage in the middle of Lancre town itself and at the heart of her own private empire. Various daughters and daughters-in-law came in to cook and clean on a sort of rota. Every flat surface was stuffed with ornaments brought back by far-traveling members of the family. Sons and grandsons kept the logpile stacked, the roof shingled, the chimney swept; the drinks cupboard was always full, the pouch by her rocking chair always stuffed with tobacco. Above the hearth was a huge pokerwork sign saying √¢‚Ç¨≈ìMother.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ No tyrant in the whole history of the world had ever achieved a domination so complete.

Nanny Ogg also kept a cat, a huge one-eyed gray tom called Greebo who divided his time between sleeping, eating and fathering the most enormous incestuous feline tribe. He opened his eye like a yellow window into Hell when he heard Granny√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s broomstick land awkwardly on the back lawn. With the instinct of his kind he recognized Granny as an inveterate cat-hater and oozed gently under a chair.

Magrat was already seated primly by the fire.

It is one of the few unbendable rules of magic that its practitioners cannot change their own appearance for any length of time. Their bodies develop a kind of morphic inertia and gradually return to their original shape. But Magrat tried. Every morning her hair was long, thick and blond, but by the evening it had always returned to its normal worried frizz. To ameliorate the effect she had tried to plait violets and cowslips in it. The result was not all she had hoped. It gave the impression that a window box had fallen on her head.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìGood evening,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ said Granny.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìWell met by moonlight,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ said Magrat politely. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìMerry meet. A star shines on√¢‚Ç¨‚Äù√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìWotcha,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ said Nanny Ogg. Magrat winced.

Granny sat down and started removing the pins that nailed her tall hat to her bun. Finally the sight of Magrat dawned on her.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìMagrat!√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

The young witch jumped, and clamped her knuckly hands to the virtuous frontage of her gown.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìYes?√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ she quavered.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìWhat have you got on your lap?√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìIt√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s my familiar,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ she said defensively.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìWhat happened to that toad you had?√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìIt wandered off,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ muttered Magrat. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìAnyway, it wasn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t very good.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

Granny sighed. Magrat√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s desperate search for a reliable familiar had been going on for some time, and despite the love and attention she lavished on them they all seemed to have some terrible flaw, such as a tendency to bite, get trodden on or, in extreme cases, metamorphose.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìThat makes fifteen this year,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ said Granny. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìNot counting the horse. What√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s this one?√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìIt√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s a rock,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ chuckled Nanny Ogg.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìWell, at least it should last,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ said Granny.

The rock extended a head and gave her a look of mild amusement.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìIt√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s a tortoise,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ said Magrat. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìI bought it down in Sheep-ridge market. It√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s incredibly old and knows many secrets, the man said.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìI know that man,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ said Granny. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìHe√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s the one who sells goldfish that tarnish after a day or two.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìAnyway, I shall call him Lightfoot,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ said Magrat, her voice warm with defiance. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìI can if I want.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìYes, yes, all right, I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m sure,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ said Granny. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìAnyway, how goes it, sisters? It is two months since last we met.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìIt should be every new moon,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ said Magrat sternly. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìRegular.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìIt was our Grame√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s youngest√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s wedding,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ said Nanny Ogg. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìCouldn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t miss it.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìAnd I was up all night with a sick goat,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ said Granny Weatherwax promptly.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìYes, well,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ said Magrat doubtfully. She rummaged in her bag. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìAnyway, if we√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re going to start, we√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢d better light the candles.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

The senior witches exchanged a resigned glance.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìBut we got this lovely new lamp our Tracie sent me,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ said Nanny Ogg innocently. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìAnd I was going to poke up the fire a bit.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìI have excellent night vision, Magrat,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ said Granny sternly. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìAnd you√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve been reading them funny books. Grimmers.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìGrimories√¢‚Ç¨‚Äù√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìYou ain√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t going to draw on the floor again, neither,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ warned Nanny Ogg. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìIt took our Dreen days to clean up all those wossnames last time√¢‚Ç¨‚Äù√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìRunes,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ said Magrat. There was a look of pleading in her eyes. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìLook, just one candle?√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìAll right,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ said Nanny Ogg, relenting a bit. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìIf it makes you feel any better. Just the one, mind. And a decent white one. Nothing fancy.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

Magrat sighed. It probably wasn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t a good idea to bring out the rest of the contents of her bag.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìWe ought to get a few more here,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ she said sadly. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìIt√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s not right, a coven of three.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìI didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t know we was still a coven. No one told me we was still a coven,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ sniffed Granny Weatherwax. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìAnyway, there√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s no one else this side of the mountain, excepting old Gammer Dismass, and she doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t get out these days.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìBut a lot of young girls in my village√¢‚Ç¨¬¶√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ said Magrat. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìYou know. They could be keen.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìThat√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s not how we do it, as well you know,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ said Granny disapprovingly. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìPeople don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t go and find witchcraft, it comes and finds them.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìYes, yes,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ said Magrat. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìSorry.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìRight,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ said Granny, slightly mollified. She√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢d never mastered the talent for apologizing, but she appreciated it in other people.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìWhat about this new duke, then,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ said Nanny, to lighten the atmosphere.

Granny sat back. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìHe had some houses burned down in Bad Ass,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ she said. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìBecause of taxes.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìHow horrible,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ said Magrat.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìOld King Verence used to do that,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ said Nanny. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìTerrible temper he had.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìHe used to let people get out first, though,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ said Granny.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìOh yes,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ said Nanny, who was a staunch royalist. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìHe could be very gracious like that. He√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢d pay for them to be rebuilt, as often as not. If he remembered.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìAnd every Hogswatchnight, a side of venison. Regular,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ said Granny wistfully.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìOh, yes. Very respectful to witches, he was,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ added Nanny Ogg. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìWhen he was out hunting people, if he met me in the woods, it was always off with his helmet and √¢‚Ç¨ÀúI hope I finds you well, Mistress Ogg√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ and next day he√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢d send his butler down with a couple of bottles of something. He was a proper king.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìHunting people isn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t really right, though,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ said Magrat.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìWell, no,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ Granny Weatherwax conceded. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìBut it was only if they√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢d done something bad. He said they enjoyed it really. And he used to let them go if they gave him a good run.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìAnd then there was that great hairy thing of his,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ said Nanny Ogg.

There was a perceptible change in the atmosphere. It became warmer, darker, filled at the corners with the shadows of unspoken conspiracy.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìAh,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ said Granny Weatherwax distantly. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìHis droit de seigneur.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìNeeded a lot of exercise,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ said Nanny Ogg, staring at the fire.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìBut next day he√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢d send his housekeeper around with a bag of silver and a hamper of stuff for the wedding,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ said Granny. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìMany a couple got a proper start in life thanks to that.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìAh,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ agreed Nanny. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìOne or two individuals, too.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìEvery inch a king,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ said Granny.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìWhat are you talking about?√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ said Magrat suspiciously. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìDid he keep pets?√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

The two witches surfaced from whatever deeper current they had been swimming in. Granny Weatherwax shrugged.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìI must say,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ Magrat went on, in severe tones, √¢‚Ç¨≈ìif you think so much of the old king, you don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t seem very worried about him being killed. I mean, it was a pretty suspicious accident.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìThat√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s kings for you,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ said Granny. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìThey come and go, good and bad. His father poisoned the king we had before.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìThat was old Thargum,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ said Nanny Ogg. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìHad a big red beard, I recall. He was very gracious too, you know.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìOnly now no one must say Felmet killed the king,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ said Magrat.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìWhat?√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ said Granny.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìHe had some people executed in Lancre, the other day for saying it,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ Magrat went on. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìSpreading malicious lies, he said. He said anyone saying different will see the inside of his dungeons, only not for long. He said Verence died of natural causes.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìWell, being assassinated is natural causes for a king,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ said Granny. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìI don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t see why he√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s so sheepish about it. When old Thargum was killed they stuck his head on a pole, had a big bonfire and everyone in the palace got drunk for a week.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìI remember,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ said Nanny. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìThey carried his head all around the villages to show he was dead. Very convincing, I thought. Specially for him. He was grinning. I think it was the way he would have liked to go.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìI think we might have to keep an eye on this one, though,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ said Granny. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìI think he might be a bit clever. That√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s not a good thing, in a king. And I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t think he knows how to show respect.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìA man came to see me last week to ask if I wanted to pay any taxes,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ said Magrat. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìI told him no.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìHe came to see me, too,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ said Nanny Ogg. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìBut our Jason and our Wane went out and tole him we didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t want to join.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìSmall man, bald, black cloak?√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ said Granny thoughtfully.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìYes,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ said the other two.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìHe was hanging about in my raspberry bushes,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ said Granny. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìOnly, when I went out to see what he wanted, he ran away.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìActually, I gave him tuppence,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ said Magrat. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìHe said he was going to be tortured, you see, if he didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t get witches to pay their taxes√¢‚Ç¨¬¶√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩÒ
