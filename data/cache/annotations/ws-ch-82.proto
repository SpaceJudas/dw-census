™O√¢‚Ç¨≈ìI think,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ said Tomjon, √¢‚Ç¨≈ìthat we√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re lost.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

Hwel looked at the baking purple moorland around them, which stretched up to the towering spires of the Ramtops themselves. Even in the height of summer there were pennants of snow flying from the highest peaks. It was a landscape of describable beauty.

Bees were busy, or at least endeavoring to look and sound busy, in the thyme by the trackside. Cloud shadows flickered over the alpine meadows. There was the kind of big, empty silence made by an environment that not only doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t have any people in it, but doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t need them either.

Or signposts.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìWe were lost ten miles ago,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ said Hwel. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìThere√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s got to be a new word for what we are now.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìYou said the mountains were honeycombed with dwarf mines,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ said Tomjon. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìYou said a dwarf could tell wherever he was in the mountains.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìUnderground, I said. It√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s all a matter of strata and rock formations. Not on the surface. All the landscape gets in the way.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìWe could dig you a hole,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ said Tomjon.

But it was a nice day and, as the road meandered through clumps of hemlock and pine, outposts of the forest, it was pleasant enough to let the mules go at their own pace. The road, Hwel felt, had to go somewhere.

This geographical fiction has been the death of many people. Roads don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t necessarily have to go anywhere, they just have to have somewhere to start.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìWe are lost, aren√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t we?√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ said Tomjon, after a while.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìCertainly not.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìWhere are we, then?√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìThe mountains. Perfectly clear on any atlas.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìWe ought to stop and ask someone.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

Tomjon gazed around at the rolling countryside. Somewhere a lonely curlew howled, or possibly it was a badgar√¢‚Ç¨‚ÄùHwel was a little hazy about rural matters, at least those that took place higher than about the limestone layer. There wasn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t another human being within miles.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìWho did you have in mind?√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ he said sarcastically.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìThat old woman in the funny hat,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ said Tomjon, pointing. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìI√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve been watching her. She keeps ducking down behind a bush when she thinks I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve seen her.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

Hwel turned and looked down at a bramble bush, which wobbled.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìHo there, good mother,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ he said.

The bush sprouted an indignant head.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìWhose mother?√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ it said.

Hwel hesitated. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìJust a figure of speech, Mrs√¢‚Ç¨¬¶Miss√¢‚Ç¨¬¶√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìMistress,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ snapped Granny Weatherwax. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìAnd I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m a poor old woman gathering wood,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ she added defiantly.

She cleared her throat. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìLawks,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ she went on. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìYou did give me a fright, young master. My poor old heart.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

There was silence from the carts. Then Tomjon said, √¢‚Ç¨≈ìI√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m sorry?√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìWhat?√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ said Granny.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìYour poor old heart what?√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìWhat about my poor old heart?√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ said Granny, who wasn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t used to acting like an old woman and had a very limited repertoire in this area. But it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s traditional that young heirs seeking their destiny get help from mysterious old women gathering wood, and she wasn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t about to buck tradition.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìIt√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s just that you mentioned it,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ said Hwel.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìWell, it isn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t important. Lawks. I expect you√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re looking for Lancre,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ said Granny testily, in a hurry to get to the point.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìWell, yes,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ said Tomjon. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìAll day.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìYou√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve come too far,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ said Granny. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìGo back about two miles, and take the track on the right, past the stand of pines.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

Wimsloe tugged at Tomjon√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s shirt.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìWhen you m-meet a m-mysterious old lady in the road,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ he said, √¢‚Ç¨≈ìyou√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve got to offer to s-share your lunch. Or help her across the r-river.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìYou have?√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìIt√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s t-terribly b-bad luck not to.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

Tomjon gave Granny a polite smile.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìWould you care to share our lunch, good mo√¢‚Ç¨‚Äùold wo√¢‚Ç¨‚Äùma√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢am?√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

Granny looked doubtful.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìWhat is it?√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìSalt pork.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

She shook her head. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìThanks all the same,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ she said graciously. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìBut it gives me wind.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

She turned on her heel and set off through the bushes.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìWe could help you across the river if you like,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ shouted Tomjon after her.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìWhat river?√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ said Hwel. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìWe√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re on the moor, there can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t be a river in miles.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìY-you√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve got to get them on y-your side,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ said Wimsloe. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìThen t-they help you.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìPerhaps we should have asked her to wait while we went and looked for one,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ said Hwel sourly.

They found the turning. It led into a forest criss-crossed with as many tracks as a marshalling yard, the sort of forest where the back of your head tells you the trees are turning around to watch you as you go past and the sky seems to be very high up and a long way off. Despite the heat of the day a dank, impenetrable gloom hovered among the tree trunks, which crowded up to the track as if intending to obliterate it completely.

They were soon lost again, and decided that being lost somewhere where you didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t know where you were was even worse than being lost in the open.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìShe could have given more explicit instructions,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ said Hwel.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìLike ask at the next crone,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ said Tomjon. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìLook over there.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

He stood up in the seat.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìHo there, old√¢‚Ç¨¬¶good√¢‚Ç¨¬¶√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ he hazarded.

Magrat pushed back her shawl.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìJust a humble wood gatherer,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ she snapped. She held up a twig for proof. Several hours waiting with nothing but trees to talk to hadn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t improved her temper.

Wimsloe nudged Tomjon, who nodded and fixed his face in an ingratiating smile.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìWould you care to share our lunch, old√¢‚Ç¨¬¶good wo√¢‚Ç¨¬¶miss?√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ he said. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìIt√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s only salt pork, I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m afraid.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìMeat is extremely bad for the digestive system,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ said Magrat. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìIf you could see inside your colon you√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢d be horrified.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìI think I would,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ muttered Hwel.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìDid you know that an adult male carries up to five pounds of undigested red meat in his intestines at all times?√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ said Magrat, whose informative lectures on nutrition had been known to cause whole families to hide in the cellar until she went away. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìWhereas pine kernels and sunflower seeds√¢‚Ç¨‚Äù√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìThere aren√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t any rivers around that you need helping over, are there?√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ said Tomjon desperately.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìDon√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t be silly,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ said Magrat. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìI√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m just a humble wood gatherer, lawks, collecting a few sticks and mayhap directing lost travelers on the road to Lancre.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìAh,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ said Hwel, √¢‚Ç¨≈ìI thought we√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢d get to that.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìYou fork left up ahead and turn right at the big stone with the crack in it, you can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t miss it,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ said Magrat.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìFine,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ growled Hwel. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìWell, we won√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t keep you. I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m sure you√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve got a lot of wood to collect and so forth.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

He whistled the mules into a plod again, grumbling to himself.

When, an hour later, the track ran out among a landscape of house-sized boulders, Hwel laid down the reins carefully and folded his arms. Tomjon stared at him.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìWhat do you think you√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re doing?√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ he said.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìWaiting,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ said the dwarf grimly.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìIt√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ll be getting dark soon.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìWe won√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t be here long,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ said Hwel.

Eventually Nanny Ogg gave up and came out from behind her rock.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìIt√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s salt pork, understand?√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ said Hwel sharply. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìTake it or leave it, OK? Now√¢‚Ç¨‚Äùwhich way√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s Lancre?√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìKeep on, left at the ravine, then you pick up the track that leads to a bridge, you can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t miss it,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ said Nanny promptly.

Hwel grabbed the reins. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìYou forgot about the lawks.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìBugger. Sorry. Lawks.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìAnd you√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re a humble old wood gatherer, I expect,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ Hwel went on.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìSpot on, lad,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ said Nanny cheerfully. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìJust about to make a start, as a matter of fact.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

Tomjon nudged the dwarf.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìYou forgot about the river,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ he said. Hwel glared at him.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìOh yes,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ he muttered, √¢‚Ç¨≈ìand can you wait here while we go and find a river.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìTo help you across,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ said Tomjon carefully.

Nanny Ogg gave him a bright smile. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìThere√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s a perfectly good bridge,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ she said. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìBut I wouldn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t say no to a lift. Move over.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

To Hwel√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s irritation Nanny Ogg hitched up her skirts and scrambled onto the board, inserting herself between Tomjon and the dwarf and then twisting like an oyster knife until she occupied half the seat.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìYou mentioned salt pork,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ she said. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìThere wouldn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t be any mustard, would there?√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìNo,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ said Hwel sullenly.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìCan√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t abide salt pork without condiments,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ said Nanny conversationally. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìBut pass it over, anyway.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ Wimsloe wordlessly handed over the basket holding the troupe√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s supper. Nanny lifted the lid and gave it a critical assessment.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìThat cheese in there is a bit off,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ she said. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìIt needs eating up quick. What√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s in the leather bottle?√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìBeer,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ said Tomjon, a fraction of a second before Hwel had the presence of mind to say, √¢‚Ç¨≈ìWater.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìPretty weak stuff,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ said Nanny, eventually. She fumbled in her apron pocket for her tobacco pouch.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìHas anyone got a light?√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ she inquired.

A couple of actors produced bundles of matches. Nanny nodded, and put the pouch away.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìGood,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ she said. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìNow, has anyone got any tobacco?√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩôk
