ÜFThe duke smiled out over the forest.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìIt works,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ he said. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìThe people mutter against the witches. How do you do it, Fool?√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìJokes, nuncle. And gossip. People are halfway ready to believe it anyway. Everyone respects the witches. The point is that no one actually likes them very much.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

Friday afternoon, he thought. I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ll have to get some flowers. And my best suit, the one with the silver bells. Oh gosh.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìThis is very pleasing. If it goes on like this, Fool, you shall have a knighthood.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

This was no. 302, and the Fool knew better than to let a feed line go hungry. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìMarry, nuncle,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ he said wearily, ignoring the spasm of pain that crawled across the duke√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s face, √¢‚Ç¨≈ìif√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢n I had a Knighthood (Night Hood), why, it would keep my ears Warm in Bedde; i√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢faith, if many a Knight is a Fool, why, should a√¢‚Ç¨‚Äù√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìYes, yes, all right,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ snapped Lord Felmet. In fact he was feeling much better already. His porridge hadn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t been over-salted this evening, and there was a decently empty feel about the castle. There were no more voices on the cusp of hearing.

He sat down on the throne. It felt really comfortable for the first time.

The duchess sat beside him, her chin on her hand, watching the Fool intently. This bothered him. He thought he knew where he stood with the duke, it was just a matter of hanging on until his madness curved back to the cheerful stage, but the duchess genuinely frightened him.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìIt seems that words are extremely powerful,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ she said.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìIndeed, lady.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìYou must have made a lengthy study.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

The Fool nodded. The power of words had sustained him through the hell of the Guild. Wizards and witches used words as if they were tools to get things done, but the Fool reckoned that words were things in their own right.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìWords can change the world,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ he said.

Her eyes narrowed.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìSo you have said before. I remain unconvinced. Strong men change the world,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ she said. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìStrong men and their deeds. Words are just like marzipan on a cake. Of course you think words are important. You are weak, you have nothing else.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìYour ladyship is wrong.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

The duchess√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s fat hand drummed impatiently on the arm of her throne.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìYou had better,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ she said, √¢‚Ç¨≈ìbe able to substantiate that comment.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìLady, the duke wishes to chop down the forests, is this not so?√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìThe trees talk about me,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ whispered Lord Felmet. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìI hear them whisper when I go riding. They tell lies about me!√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

The duchess and the Fool exchanged glances.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìBut,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ the Fool continued, √¢‚Ç¨≈ìthis policy has met with fanatical opposition.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìWhat?√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìPeople don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t like it.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

The duchess exploded. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìWhat does that matter?√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ she roared. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìWe rule! They will do what we say or they will be pitilessly executed!√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

The Fool bobbed and capered and waved his hands in a conciliatory fashion.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìBut, my love, we will run out of people,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ murmured the duke.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìNo need, no need!√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ said the Fool desperately. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìYou don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t have to do that at all! What you do is, you√¢‚Ç¨‚Äù√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ he paused for a moment, his lips moving quickly√¢‚Ç¨‚Äù√¢‚Ç¨≈ìyou embark upon a far-reaching and ambitious plan to expand the agricultural industry, provide long-term employment in the sawmills, open new land for development, and reduce the scope for banditry.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

This time the duke looked baffled. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìHow will I do that?√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ he said.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìChop down the forests.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìBut you said√¢‚Ç¨‚Äù√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìShut up, Felmet,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ said the duchess. She subjected the Fool to another long, thoughtful stare.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìExactly how,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ she said, eventually, √¢‚Ç¨≈ìdoes one go about knocking over the houses of people one does not like?√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìUrban clearance,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ said the Fool.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìI was thinking of burning them down.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìHygienic urban clearance,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ the Fool added promptly.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìAnd sowing the ground with salt.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìMarry, I suspect that is hygienic urban clearance and a program of environmental improvements. It might be a good idea to plant a few trees as well.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìNo more trees!√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ shouted Felmet.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìOh, it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s all right. They won√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t survive. The important thing is to have planted them.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìBut I also want us to raise taxes,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ said the duchess.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìWhy, nuncle√¢‚Ç¨‚Äù√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìAnd I am not your nuncle.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìN√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢aunt?√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ said the Fool.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìNo.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìWhy√¢‚Ç¨¬¶prithee√¢‚Ç¨¬¶you need to finance your ambitious program for the country.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìSorry?√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ said the duke, who was getting lost again.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìHe means that chopping down trees costs money,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ said the duchess. She smiled at the Fool. It was the first time he had ever seen her look at him as if he was other than a disgusting little cockroach. There was still a large element of cockroach in her glance, but it said: good little cockroach, you have learned a trick.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìIntriguing,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ she said. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìBut can your words change the past?√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

The Fool considered this.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìMore easily, I think,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ he said. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìBecause the past is what people remember, and memories are words. Who knows how a king behaved a thousand years ago? There is only recollection, and stories. And plays, of course.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìAh, yes. I saw a play once,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ said Felmet. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìBunch of funny fellows in tights. A lot of shouting. The people liked it.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìYou tell me history is what people are told?√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ said the duchess.

The Fool looked around the throne room and found King Gruneberry the Good (906-967).

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìWas he?√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ he said, pointing. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìWho knows, now? What was he good at? But he will be Gruneberry the Good until the end of the world.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

The duke was leaning forward in his throne, his eyes gleaming.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìI want to be a good ruler,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ he said. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìI want people to like me. I would like people to remember me fondly.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìLet us assume,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ said the duchess, √¢‚Ç¨≈ìthat there were other matters, subject to controversy. Matters of historical record that had√¢‚Ç¨¬¶been clouded.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìI didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t do it, you know,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ said the duke, quickly. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìHe slipped and fell. That was it. Slipped and fell. I wasn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t even there. He attacked me. It was self-defense.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ His voice fell to a mumble. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìI have no recollection of it at this time,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ he murmured. He rubbed his dagger hand, although the word was becoming inappropriate.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìBe quiet, husband,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ snapped the duchess. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìI know you didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t do it. I wasn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t there with you, you may recall. It was I who didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t hand you the dagger.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ The duke shuddered again.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìAnd now, Fool,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ said Lady Felmet. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìI was saying, I believe, that perhaps there are matters that should be properly recorded.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìMarry, that you were not there at the time?√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ said the Fool, brightly.

It is true that words have power, and one of the things they are able to do is get out of someone√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s mouth before the speaker has the chance to stop them. If words were sweet little lambs, then the Fool watched them bound cheerfully away into the flame-thrower of the duchess√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s glare.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìNot where?√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ she said.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìAnywhere,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ said the Fool hastily.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìStupid man! Everyone is somewhere.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìI mean, you were everywhere but at the top of the stairs,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ said the Fool.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìWhich stairs?√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìAny stairs,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ said the Fool, who was beginning to sweat. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìI distinctly remember not seeing you!√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

The duchess eyed him for a while.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìSo long as you remember it,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ she said. The duchess rubbed her chin, which made an audible rasping noise.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìReality is only weak words, you say. Therefore, words are reality. But how can words become history?√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìIt was a very good play, the play that I saw,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ said Felmet dreamily. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìThere were fights, and no one really died. Some very good speeches, I thought.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

There was another sandpapery sound from the duchess.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìFool?√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ she said.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìLady?√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìCan you write a play? A play that will go around the world, a play that will be remembered long after rumor has died?√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìNo, lady. It is a special talent.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìBut can you find someone who has it?√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìThere are such people, lady.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìFind one,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ murmured the duke. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìFind the best. Find the best. The truth will out. Find one.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩÚ
