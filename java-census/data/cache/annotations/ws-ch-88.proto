∞HThe castle was full of people standing around in that polite, sheepish way affected by people who see each other all day and are now seeing each other again in unusual social circumstances, like an office party. The witches passed quite unremarked among them and found seats in the rows of benches in the main courtyard, set up before a hastily assembled stage.

Nanny Ogg waved her bag of walnuts at Granny.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìWant one?√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ she said.

An alderman of Lancre shuffled past her and pointed politely to the seat on her left.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìIs anyone sitting here?√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ he said.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìYes,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ said Nanny.

The alderman looked distractedly at the rest of the benches, which were filling up fast, and then down at the clearly empty space in front of him. He hitched up his robes with a determined expression.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìI think that since the play is commencing to start, your friends must find a seat elsewhere, when they arrive,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ he said, and sat down.

Within seconds his face went white. His teeth began to chatter. He clutched at his stomach and groaned.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìI told you,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ said Nanny, as he lurched away. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìWhat√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s the good of asking if you√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re not going to listen?√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ She leaned toward the empty seat. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìWalnut?√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìNo, thank you,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ said King Verence, waving a spectral hand. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìThey go right through me, you know.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìPray, gentles all, list to our tale√¢‚Ç¨¬¶√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìWhat√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s this?√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ hissed Granny. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìWho√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s the fellow in the tights?√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìHe√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s the Prologue,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ said Nanny. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìYou have to have him at the beginning so everyone knows what the play√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s about.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìCan√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t understand a word of it,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ muttered Granny. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìWhat√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s a gentle, anyway?√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìType of maggot,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ said Nanny.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìThat√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s nice, isn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t it? √¢‚Ç¨ÀúHallo maggots, welcome to the show.√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ Puts people in a nice frame of mind, doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t it?√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

There was a chorus of √¢‚Ç¨≈ìsshs.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìThese walnuts are damn tough,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ said Nanny, spitting one out into her hand. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìI√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m going to have to take my shoe off to this one.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

Granny subsided into unaccustomed, troubled silence, and tried to listen to the prologue. The theater worried her. It had a magic of its own, one that didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t belong to her, one that wasn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t in her control. It changed the world, and said things were otherwise than they were. And it was worse than that. It was magic that didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t belong to magical people. It was commanded by ordinary people, who didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t know the rules. They altered the world because it sounded better.

The duke and duchess were sitting on their thrones right in front of the stage. As Granny glared at them the duke half turned, and she saw his smile.

I want the world the way it is, she thought. I want the past the way it was. The past used to be a lost better than it is now.

And the band struck up.

Hwel peered around a pillar and signaled to Wimsloe and Brattsley, who hobbled out into the glare of the torches.

OLD MAN (an Elder): √¢‚Ç¨≈ìWhat hath befell the land?√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

OLD WOMAN (a Crone): √¢‚Ç¨≈ì√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢Tis a terror√¢‚Ç¨‚Äù√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

The dwarf watched them for a few seconds from the wings, his lips moving soundlessly. Then he scuttled back to the guardroom where the rest of the cast were still in the last hasty stages of dressing. He uttered the stage manager√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s traditional scream of rage.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìC√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢mon,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ he ordered. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìSoldiers of the king, at the double! And the witches√¢‚Ç¨‚Äùwhere are the blasted witches?√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

Three junior apprentices presented themselves.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìI√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve lost my wart!√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìThe cauldon√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s all full of yuk!√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìThere√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s something living in this wig!√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìCalm down, calm down,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ screamed Hwel. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìIt√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ll all be all right on the night!√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìThis is the night, Hwel!√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

Hwel snatched a handful of putty from the makeup table and slammed on a wart like an orange. The offending straw wig was rammed on its owner√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s head, livestock and all, and the cauldron was very briefly inspected and pronounced full of just the right sort of yuk, nothing wrong with yuk like that.

On stage a guard dropped his shield, bent down to pick it up, and dropped his spear. Hwel rolled his eyes and offered up a silent prayer to any gods that might be watching.

It was already going wrong. The earlier rehearsals had their little teething troubles, it was true, but Hwel had known one or two monumental horrors in his time and this one was shaping up to be the worst. The company was more jittery than a potful of lobsters. Out of the corner of his ear he heard the on-stage dialogue falter, and scurried to the wings.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ì√¢‚Ç¨‚Äùavenge the terror of thy father√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s death√¢‚Ç¨‚Äù√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ he hissed, and hurried back to the trembling witches. He groaned. Divers alarums. This lot were supposed to be terrorizing a kingdom. He had about a minute before the cue.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìRight!√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ he said, pulling himself together. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìNow, what are you? You√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re evil hags, right?√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìYes, Hwel,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ they said meekly.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìTell me what you are,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ he commanded.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìWe√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re evil hags, Hwel.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìLouder!√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìWe√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve Evil Hags!√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

Hwel stalked the length of the quaking line, then turned abruptly on his heel, √¢‚Ç¨≈ìAnd what are you going to do?√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

The 2nd Witche scratched his crawling wig.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìWe√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re going to curse people?√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ he ventured. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìIt says in the script√¢‚Ç¨‚Äù√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìI-can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t-HEAR-you!√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìWe√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re going to curse people!√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ they chorused, springing to attention and staring straight ahead to avoid his gaze.

Hwel stumped back along the line.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìWhat are you?√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìWe√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re hags, Hwel!√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìWhat kind of hags?√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìWe√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re black and midnight hags!√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ they yelled, getting into the spirit.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìWhat kind of black and midnight hags?√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìEvil black and midnight hags!√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìAre you scheming?√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìYeah!√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìAre you secret?√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìYeah!√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

Hwel drew himself to his full height, such as it was.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìWhat-are-you?√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ he screamed.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìWe√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re scheming evil secret black and midnight hags!√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìRight!√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ He pointed a vibrating finger toward the stage and lowered his voice and, at that moment, a dramatic inspiration dived through the atmosphere and slammed into his creative node, causing him to say, √¢‚Ç¨≈ìNow I want you to get out there and give √¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢em hell. Not for me. Not for the goddam captain.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ He shifted the butt of an imaginary cigar from one side of his mouth to the other, and pushed back a nonexistent tin helmet, and rasped, √¢‚Ç¨≈ìBut for Corporal Walkowski and his little dawg.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

They stared at him in disbelief.

On cue, someone shook a sheet of tin and broke the spell.

Hwel rolled his eyes. He√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢d grown up in the mountains, where thunderstorms stalked from peak to peak on legs of lightning. He remembered thunderstorms that left mountains a different shape and flattened whole forests. Somehow, a sheet of tin wasn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t the same, no matter how enthusiastically it was shaken.

Just once, he thought, just once. Let me get it right just once.

He opened his eyes and glared at the witches.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìWhat are you hanging around here for?√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ he yelled. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìGet out there and curse them!√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

He watched them scamper onto the stage, and then Tomjon tapped him on the head.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìHwel, there√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s no crown.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìHmm?√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ said the dwarf, his mind wrestling with ways of building thunder-and-lightning machines.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìThere√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s no crown, Hwel. I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve got to wear a crown.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìOf course there√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s a crown. The big one with the red glass, very impressive, we used it in that place with the big square√¢‚Ç¨‚Äù√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìI think we left it there.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

There was another tinny roll of thunder but, even so, the part of Hwel that was living the play heard a faltering voice on stage. He darted to the wings.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ì√¢‚Ç¨‚ÄùI have smother√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢d many a babe√¢‚Ç¨‚Äù√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ he hissed, and sprinted back.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìWell, just find another one, then,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ he said vaguely. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìIn the props box. You√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re the Evil King, you√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve got to have a crown. Get on with it, lad, you√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re on in a few minutes. Improvise.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

Tomjon wandered back to the box. He√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢d grown up among crowns, big golden crowns made of wood and plaster, studded with finest glass. He√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢d cut his teeth on the hat-brims of Authority. But most of them had been left in the Dysk now. He pulled out collapsible daggers and skulls and vases, the strata of the years and, right at the bottom, his fingers closed on something thin and crown shaped, which no one had ever wanted to wear because it looked so uncrownly.

It would be nice to say it tingled under his hand. Perhaps it did.£i
