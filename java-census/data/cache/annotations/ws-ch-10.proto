Ô]√¢‚Ç¨≈ìIt√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s meddling, that√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s what it is,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ said Granny Weatherwax. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìAnd no good will come of it.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìIt√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s very romantic,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ said Magrat breathily, and heaved a sigh.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìGoochy goo,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ said Nanny Ogg.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìAnyway,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ said Magrat, √¢‚Ç¨≈ìyou killed that horrid man!√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìI never did. I just encouraged√¢‚Ç¨¬¶things to take their course.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ Granny Weatherwax frowned. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìHe didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t have no respect. Once people lose their respect, it means trouble.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìIzzy wizzy wazzy, den.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìThat other man brought him out here to save him!√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ shouted Magrat. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìHe wanted us to keep him safe! It√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s obvious! It√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s destiny!√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìOh, obvious,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ said Granny. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìI√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ll grant you it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s obvious. Trouble is, just because things are obvious doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t mean they√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re true.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

She weighed the crown in her hands. It felt very heavy, in a way that went beyond mere pounds and ounces.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìYes, but the point is√¢‚Ç¨‚Äù√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ Magrat began.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìThe point is,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ said Granny, √¢‚Ç¨≈ìthat people are going to come looking. Serious people. Serious looking. Pull-down-the-walls and burn-off-the-thatch looking. And√¢‚Ç¨‚Äù√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìHowsa boy, den?√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ì√¢‚Ç¨‚ÄùAnd, Gytha, I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m sure we√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ll all be a lot happier if you√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢d stop gurgling like that!√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ Granny snapped. She could feel her nerves coming on. Her nerves always played up when she was unsure about things. Besides, they had retired to Magrat√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s cottage, and the decor was getting to her, because Magrat believed in Nature√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s wisdom and elves and the healing power of colors and the cycle of the seasons and a lot of other things Granny Weatherwax didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t have any truck with.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìYou√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re not after telling me how to look after a child,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ snapped Nanny Ogg mildly. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìAnd me with fifteen of my own?√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìI√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m just saying that we ought to think about it,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ said Granny.

The other two watched her for some time.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìWell?√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ said Magrat.

Granny√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s fingers drummed on the edge of the crown. She frowned.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìFirst, we√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve got to take him away from here,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ she said, and held up a hand. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìNo, Gytha, I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m sure your cottage is ideal and everything, but it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s not safe. He√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s got to be somewhere away from here, a long way away, where no one knows who he is. And then there√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s this.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ She tossed the crown from hand to hand.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìOh, that√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s easy,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ said Magrat. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìI mean, you just hide it under a stone or something. That√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s easy. Much easier than babies.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìIt ain√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ said Granny. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìThe reason being, the country√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s full of babies and they all look the same, but I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t reckon there√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s many crowns. They have this way of being found, anyway. They kind of call out to people√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s minds. If you bunged it under a stone up here, in a week√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s time it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢d get itself discovered by accident. You mark my words.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìIt√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s true, is that,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ said Nanny Ogg, earnestly. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìHow many times have you thrown a magic ring into the deepest depths of the ocean and then, when you get home and have a nice bit of turbot for your tea, there it is?√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

They considered this in silence.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìNever,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ said Granny irritably. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìAnd nor have you. Anyway, he might want it back. If it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s rightfully his, that is. Kings set a lot of store by crowns. Really, Gytha, sometimes you say the most√¢‚Ç¨‚Äù√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìI√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ll just make some tea, shall I?√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ said Magrat brightly, and disappeared into the scullery.

The two elderly witches sat on either side of the table in polite and prickly silence. Finally Nanny Ogg said, √¢‚Ç¨≈ìShe done it up nice, hasn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t she? Flowers and everything. What are them things on the walls?√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìSigils,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ said Granny sourly. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìOr some such.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìFancy,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ said Nanny Ogg, politely. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìAnd all them robes and wands and things too.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìModern,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ said Granny Weatherwax, with a sniff. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìWhen I was a gel, we had a lump of wax and a couple of pins and had to be content. We had to make our own enchantment in them days.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìAh, well, we√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve all passed a lot of water since then,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ said Nanny Ogg sagely. She gave the baby a comforting jiggle.

Granny Weatherwax sniffed. Nanny Ogg had been married three times and ruled a tribe of children and grandchildren all over the kingdom. Certainly, it was not actually forbidden for witches to get married. Granny had to concede that, but reluctantly. Very reluctantly. She sniffed again, disapprovingly; this was a mistake.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìWhat√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s that smell?√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ she snapped.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìAh,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ said Nanny Ogg, carefully repositioning the baby. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìI expect I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ll just go and see if Magrat has any clean rags, shall I?√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

And now Granny was left alone. She felt embarrassed, as one always does when left alone in someone else√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s room, and fought the urge to get up and inspect the books on the shelf over the sideboard or examine the mantelpiece for dust. She turned the crown around and around in her hands. Again, it gave the impression of being bigger and heavier than it actually was.

She caught sight of the mirror over the mantelpiece and looked down at the crown. It was tempting. It was practically begging her to try it for size. Well, and why not? She made sure that the others weren√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t around and then, in one movement, whipped off her hat and placed the crown on her head.

It seemed to fit. Granny drew herself up proudly, and waved a hand imperiously in the general direction of the hearth.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìJolly well do this,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ she said. She beckoned arrogantly at the grandfather clock. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìChop his head off, what ho,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ she commanded. She smiled grimly.

And froze as she heard the screams, and the thunder of horses, and the deadly whisper of arrows and the damp, solid sound of spears in flesh. Charge after charge echoed across her skull. Sword met shield, or sword, or bone√¢‚Ç¨‚Äùrelentlessly. Years streamed across her mind in the space of a second. There were times when she lay among the dead, or hanging from the branch of a tree; but always there were hands that would pick her up again, and place her on a velvet cushion√¢‚Ç¨¬¶

Granny very carefully lifted the crown off her head√¢‚Ç¨‚Äùit was an effort, it didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t like it much√¢‚Ç¨‚Äùand laid it on the table.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìSo that√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s being a king for you, is it?√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ she said softly. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìI wonder why they all want the job?√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìDo you take sugar?√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ said Magrat, behind her.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìYou√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢d have to be a born fool to be a king,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ said Granny.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìSorry?√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

Granny turned. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìDidn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t see you come in,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ she said. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìWhat was it you said?√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìSugar in your tea?√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìThree spoons,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ said Granny promptly. It was one of the few sorrows of Granny Weatherwax√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s life that, despite all her efforts, she√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢d arrived at the peak of her career with a complexion like a rosy apple and all her teeth. No amount of charms could persuade a wart to take root on her handsome if slightly equine features, and vast intakes of sugar only served to give her boundless energy. A wizard she√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢d consulted had explained it was on account of her having a metabolism, which at least allowed her to feel vaguely superior to Nanny Ogg, who she suspected had never even seen one.

Magrat dutifully dug out three heaped ones. It would be nice, she thought wistfully, if someone could say √¢‚Ç¨≈ìthank you√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ occasionally.

She became aware that the crown was staring at her.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìYou can feel it, can you?√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ said Granny. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìIt said, didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t I? Crowns call out!√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìIt√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s horrible.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìNo, no. It√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s just being what it is. It can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t help it.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìBut it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s magic!√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìIt√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s just being what it is,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ Granny repeated.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìIt√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s trying to get me to try it on,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ said Magrat, her hand hovering.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìIt does that, yes.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìBut I shall be strong,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ said Magrat.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìSo I should think,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ said Granny, her expression suddenly curiously wooden. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìWhat√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s Gytha doing?√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìShe√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s giving the baby a wash in the sink,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ said Magrat vaguely. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìHow can we hide something like this? What√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢d happen if we buried it really deeply somewhere?√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìA badger√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢d dig it up,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ said Granny wearily. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìOr someone√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢d go prospecting for gold or something. Or a tree√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢d tangle its roots around it and then be blown over in a storm, and then someone√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢d pick it up and put it on√¢‚Ç¨‚Äù√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìUnless they were as strong-minded as us,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ Magrat pointed out.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìUnless that, of course,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ said Granny, staring at her fingernails. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìThough the thing with crowns is, it isn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t the putting them on that√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s the problem, it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s the taking them off.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

Magrat picked it up and turned it over in her hands.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìIt√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s not as though it even looks much like a crown,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ she said.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìYou√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve seen a lot, I expect,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ said Granny. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìYou√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢d be an expert on them, naturally.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìSeen a fair few. They√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve got a lot more jewels on them, and cloth bits in the middle,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ said Magrat defiantly. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìThis is just a thin little thing√¢‚Ç¨‚Äù√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìMagrat Garlick!√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìI have. When I was being trained up by Goodie Whemper√¢‚Ç¨‚Äù√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ì√¢‚Ç¨‚Äùmaysherestinpeace√¢‚Ç¨‚Äù√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ì√¢‚Ç¨‚Äùmaysherestinpeace, she used to take me over to Razorback or into Lancre whenever the strolling players were in town. She was very keen on the theater. They√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve got more crowns than you can shake a stick at although, mind√¢‚Ç¨‚Äù√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ she paused√¢‚Ç¨‚Äù√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ Goodie did say they√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re made of tin and paper and stuff. And just glass for the jewels. But they look more realler than this one. Do you think that√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s strange?√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìThings that try to look like things often do look more like things than things. Well-known fact,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ said Granny. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìBut I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t hold with encouraging it. What do they stroll about playing, then, in these crowns?√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìYou don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t know about the theater?√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ said Magrat.

Granny Weatherwax, who never declared her ignorance of anything, didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t hesitate. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìOh, yes,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ she said. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìIt√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s one of them style of things, then, is it?√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìGoodie Whemper said it held a mirror up to life,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ said Magrat. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìShe said it always cheered her up.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìI expect it would,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ said Granny, striking out. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìPlayed properly, at any rate. Good people, are they, these theater players?√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìI think so.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìAnd they stroll around the country, you say?√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ said Granny thoughtfully, looking toward the scullery door.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìAll over the place. There√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s a troupe in Lancre now, I heard. I haven√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t been because, you know.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ Magrat looked down. √¢‚Ç¨≈ì√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢Tis not right, a woman going into such places by herself.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

Granny nodded. She thoroughly approved of such sentiments so long as there was, of course, no suggestion that they applied to her.

She drummed her fingers on Magrat√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s tablecloth.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìRight,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ she said. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìAnd why not? Go and tell Gytha to wrap the baby up well. It√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s a long time since I heard a theater played properly.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩÒ8
