»ÕGranny Weatherwax stalked through the passages of Lancre Castle like a large, angry bat, the duke√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s laughter echoing around her head.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìYou could give him boils or something,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ said Nanny Ogg. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìHemorrhoids are good. That√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s allowed. It won√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t stop him ruling, it just means he√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ll have to rule standing up. Always good for a laugh, that. Or piles.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

Granny Weatherwax said nothing. If fury were heat, her hat would have caught fire.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìMind you, that√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢d probably make him worse,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ said Nanny, running to keep up. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìSame with toothache.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ She gave a sideways glance at Granny√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s twitching features.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìYou needn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t fret,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ she said. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìThey didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t do anything much. But thanks, anyway.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìI ain√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t worried about you, Gytha Ogg,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ snapped Granny. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìI only come along √¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢cos Magrat was fretting. What I say is, if a witch can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t look after herself, she√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s got no business calling herself a witch.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìMagrat done well with the woodwork, I thought.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

Even in the grip of her sullen fury, Granny Weatherwax spared a nod.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìShe√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s coming along,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ she said. She looked up and down the corridor, and then leaned closer to Nanny Ogg√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s ear.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìI ain√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t going to give him the pleasure of saying it,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ she said, √¢‚Ç¨≈ìbut he√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s got us beaten.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìWell, I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t know,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ said Nanny. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìOur Jason and a few sharp lads could soon√¢‚Ç¨‚Äù√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìYou saw some of his guards. These aren√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t the old sort. These are a tough kind.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìWe could give the boys just a bit of help√¢‚Ç¨‚Äù√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìIt wouldn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t work. People have to sort this sort of thing out for themselves.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìIf you say so, Esme,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ said Nanny meekly.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìI do. Magic√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s there to be ruled, not for ruling.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

Nanny nodded and then, remembering a promise, reached down and picked up a fragment of stone from the rubble on the tunnel floor.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìI thought you√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢d forgotten,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ said the ghost of the king, by her ear.

Further down the passage the Fool was capering after Magrat.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìCan I see you again?√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ he said.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìWell√¢‚Ç¨¬¶I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t know,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ said Magrat, her heart singing a smug song.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìHow about tonight?√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ said the Fool.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìOh, no,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ said Magrat. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìI√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m very busy tonight.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ She had intended to curl up with a hot milk drink and Goodie Whemper√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s notebooks on experimental astrology, but instinct told her that any suitor should have an uphill struggle put in front of him, just to make him keener.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìTomorrow night, then?√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ the Fool persisted.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìI think I should be washing my hair.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìI could get Friday night free.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìWe do a lot of work at night, you see√¢‚Ç¨‚Äù√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìThe afternoon, then.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

Magrat hesitated. Perhaps instinct had got it wrong. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìWell√¢‚Ç¨‚Äù√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ she said.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìAbout two o√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢clock. In the meadow by the pond, all right?√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìWell√¢‚Ç¨‚Äù√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìSee you there, then. All right?√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ said the Fool desperately.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìFool!√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ The duchess√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s voice echoed along the passage, and a look of terror crossed his face.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìI√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve got to go,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ he said. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìThe meadow, OK? I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ll wear something so you recognize me. All right?√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìAll right,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ echoed Magrat, hypnotized by the sheer pressure of his persistence. She turned and ran after the other witches.

There was pandemonium outside the castle. The crowd that had been there at Granny√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s arrival had grown considerably, and had flowed in through the now unguarded gateway and lapped around the keep. Civil disobedience was new to Lancre, but its inhabitants had already mastered some of its more elementary manifestations, viz, the jerking of rakes and sickles in the air with simple up-and-down motions accompanied by grimaces and cries of √¢‚Ç¨≈ìGerrh!,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ although a few citizens, who hadn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t quite grasped the idea, were waving flags and cheering. Advanced students were already eyeing the more combustible buildings inside the walls. Several sellers of hot meat pies and sausages in a bun had appeared from nowhere and were doing a brisk trade. Pretty soon someone was going to throw something.

The three witches stood at the top of the steps that led to the keep√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s main door and surveyed the seas of faces.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìThere√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s our Jason,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ said Nanny happily. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìAnd Wane and Darron and Kev and Trev and Nev√¢‚Ç¨‚Äù√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìI will remember their faces,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ said Lord Felmet, emerging between them and putting a hand on their shoulders. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìAnd do you see my archers, on the walls?√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìI see √¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢em,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ said Granny grimly.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìThen smile and wave,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ said the duke. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìSo that the people may know that all is well. After all, have you not been to see me today on matters of state?√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

He leaned closer to Granny.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìYes, there are a hundred things you could do,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ he said. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìBut the ending would always be the same.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ He drew back. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìI√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m not an unreasonable man, I hope,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ he added, in cheerful tones. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìPerhaps, if you persuade the people to be calm, I may be prevailed upon to moderate my rule somewhat. I make no promises, of course.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

Granny said nothing.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìSmile and wave,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ commanded the duke.

Granny raised one hand in a vague motion and produced a brief rictus that had nothing whatsoever to do with humor. Then she scowled and nudged Nanny Ogg, who was waving and mugging like a maniac.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìNo need to get carried away,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ she hissed.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìBut there√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s our Reet and our Sharleen and their babbies,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ said Nanny. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìCoo-eee!√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìWill you shut up, you daft old besom!√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ snapped Granny. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìAnd pull yourself together!√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìJolly good, well done,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ said the duke. He raised his hands, or at least his hand. The other still ached. He√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢d tried the grater again last night, but it hadn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t worked.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìPeople of Lancre,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ he cried, √¢‚Ç¨≈ìdo not be afeared! I am your friend. I will protect you from the witches! They have agreed to leave you in peace!√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

Granny stared at him as he spoke. He√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s one of these here maniac depressives, she said. Up and down like a wossname. Kill you one minute and ask you how you√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re feeling the next.

She became aware that he was looking at her expectantly.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìWhat?√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìI said, I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ll now call upon the respected Granny Weatherwax to say a few words, ha ha,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ he said.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìYou said that, did you?√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìYes!√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìYou√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve gone a long way too far,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ said Granny.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìI have, haven√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t I!√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ The duke giggled.

Granny turned to the expectant crowds, which went silent.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìGo home,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ she said.

There was a further long silence.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìIs that all?√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ said the duke.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìYes.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìWhat about pledges of eternal allegiance?√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìWhat about them? Gytha, will you stop waving at people!√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìSorry.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìAnd now we are going to go, too,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ said Granny.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìBut we were getting on so well,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ said the duke.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìCome, Gytha,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ said Granny icily. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìAnd where√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s Magrat got to?√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

Magrat looked up guiltily. She had been deep in conversation with the Fool, although it was the kind of conversation where both parties spend a lot of time looking at their feet and picking at their fingernails. Ninety percent of true love is acute, ear-burning embarrassment.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìWe√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re leaving,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ said Granny.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìFriday afternoon, remember,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ hissed the Fool.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìWell, if I can,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ said Magrat.

Nanny Ogg leered.

And so Granny Weatherwax swept down the steps and through the crowds, with the other two running behind her. Several of the grinning guards caught her eye and wished they hadn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t, but here and there, among the watching crowd, was a barely suppressed snigger. She hurtled through the gateway, across the drawbridge and through the town. Granny walking fast could beat most other people at a run.

Behind them the duke, who had crested the latest maniac peak on the switchback of his madness and was coasting speedily toward the watersplash of despair, laughed.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìHa ha.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

Granny didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t stop until she was outside the town and under the welcoming eaves of the forest. She turned off the road and flumped down on a log, her face in her hands.

The other two approached her carefully. Magrat patted her on the back.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìDon√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t despair,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ she said. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìYou handled it very well, we thought.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìI ain√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t despairing, I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m thinking,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ said Granny. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìGo away.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

Nanny Ogg raised her eyebrows at Magrat in a warning fashion. They backed off to a suitable distance although, with Granny in her present mood, the next universe might not be far enough, and sat down on a moss-grown stone.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìAre you all right?√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ said Magrat. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìThey didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t do anything, did they?√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìNever laid a finger on me,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ said Nanny. She sniffed. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìThey√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re not your real royalty,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ she added. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìOld King Gruneweld, for one, he wouldn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t have wasted time waving things around and menacing people. It√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢d been bang, needles right under the fingernails from the word go, and no messing. None of this evil laughter stuff. He was a real king. Very gracious.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìHe was threatening to burn you.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìOh, I wouldn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t of stood for it. I see you√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve got a follower,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ said Nanny.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìSorry?√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ said Magrat.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìThe young fellow with the bells,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ said Nanny. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìAnd the face like a spaniel what√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s just been kicked.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìOh, him.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ Magrat blushed hotly under her pale makeup. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìReally, he√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s just this man. He just follows me around.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìCan be difficult, can that,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ said Nanny sagely.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìBesides, he√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s so small. And he capers all over the place,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ said Magrat.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìLooked at him carefully, have you?√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ said the old witch.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìPardon?√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìYou haven√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t, have you? I thought not. He√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s a very clever man, that Fool. He ought to have been one of them actor men.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìWhat do you mean?√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìNext time you have a look at him like a witch, not like a woman,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ said Nanny, and gave Magrat a conspiratorial nudge. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìGood bit of work with the door back there,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ she added. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìComing on well, you are. I hope you told him about Greebo.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìHe said he√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢d let him out directly, Nanny.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

There was a snort from Granny Weatherwax.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìDid you hear the sniggering in the crowd?√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ she said. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìSomeone sniggered!√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

Nanny Ogg sat down beside her.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìAnd a couple of them pointed,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ she said. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìI know.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìIt√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s not to be borne!√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

Magrat sat down on the other end of the log.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìThere√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s other witches,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ she said. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìThere√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s lots of witches further up the Ramtops. Maybe they can help.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

The other two looked at her in pained surprise.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìI don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t think we need go that far,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ sniffed Granny. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìAsking for help.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìVery bad practice,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ nodded Nanny Ogg.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìBut you asked a demon to help you,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ said Magrat.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìNo, we didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ said Granny.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìRight. We didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìWe ordered it to assist.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìS√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢right.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

Granny Weatherwax stretched out her legs and looked at her boots. They were good strong boots, with hobnails and crescent-shaped scads; you couldn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t believe a cobbler had made them, someone had laid down a sole and built up from there.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìI mean, there√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s that witch over Skund way,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ she said. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìSister Whosis, wossname, her son went off to be a sailor√¢‚Ç¨‚Äùyou know, Gytha, her who sniffs and puts them antimassacres on the backs of chairs soon as you sits down√¢‚Ç¨‚Äù√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìGrodley,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ said Nanny Ogg. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìSticks her little finger out when she drinks her tea and drops her Haitches all the time.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìYes. Hwell. I haven√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t hlowered myself to talk to her hever since that business with the gibbet, you recall. I daresay she√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢d just love to come snooping haround here, running her fingers over heverything and sniffling, telling us how to do things. Oh, yes. Help. We√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢d all be in a fine to-do if we went around helping all the time.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìYes, and over Skund way the trees talk to you and walk around of night,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ said Nanny. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìWithout even asking permission. Very poor organization.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìNot really good organization, like we√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve got here?√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ said Magrat.

Granny stood up purposefully.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìI√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m going home,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ she said.

There are thousands of good reasons why magic doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t rule the world. They√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re called witches and wizards, Magrat reflected, as she followed the other two back to the road.

It was probably some wonderful organization on the part of Nature to protect itself. It saw to it that everyone with any magical talent was about as ready to cooperate as a she-bear with toothache, so all that dangerous power was safely dissipated as random bickering and rivalry. There were differences in style, of course. Wizards assassinated each other in drafty corridors, witches just cut one another dead in the street. And they were all as self-centered as a spinning top. Even when they help other people, she thought, they√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re secretly doing it for themselves. Honestly, they√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re just like big children.

Except for me, she thought smugly.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìShe√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s very upset, isn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t she,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ said Magrat to Nanny Ogg.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìAh, well,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ said Nanny. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìThere√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s the problem, see. The more you get used to magic, the more you don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t want to use it. The more it gets in your way. I expect, when you were just starting out, you learned a few spells from Goodie Whemper, maysherestinpeace, and you used them all the time, didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t you?√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìWell, yes. Everyone does.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìWell-known fact,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ agreed Nanny. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìBut when you get along in the Craft, you learn that the hardest magic is the sort you don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t use at all.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

Magrat considered the proposition cautiously. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìThis isn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t some kind of Zen, is it?√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ she said.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìDunno. Never seen one.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìWhen we were in the dungeons, Granny said something about trying the rocks. That sounded like pretty hard magic.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìWell, Goodie wasn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t much into rocks,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ said Nanny. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìIt√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s not really hard. You just prod their memories. You know, of the old days. When they were hot and runny.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

She hesitated, and her hand flew to her pocket. She gripped the lump of castle stone and relaxed.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìThought I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢d forgotten it, for a minute,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ she said, lifting it out. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìYou can come out now.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

He was barely visible in the brightness of day, a mere shimmer in the air under the trees. King Verence blinked. He wasn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t used to daylight.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìEsme,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ said Nanny. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìThere√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s someone to see you.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

Granny turned slowly and squinted at the ghost.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìI saw you in the dungeon, didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t I?√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ she said. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìWho√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re you?√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìVerence, King of Lancre,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ said the ghost, and bowed. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìDo I have the honor of addressing Granny Weatherwax, doyenne of witches?√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

It has already been pointed out that just because Verence came from a long line of kings didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t mean that he was basically stupid, and a year without the distractions of the flesh had done wonders as well. Granny Weatherwax considered herself totally unsusceptible to buttering up, but the king was expertly applying the equivalent of the dairy surplus of quite a large country. Bowing was a particularly good touch.

A muscle twitched at the corner of Granny√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s mouth. She gave a stiff little bow in return, because she wasn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t quite sure what √¢‚Ç¨≈ìdoyenne√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ meant.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìI√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m her,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ she conceded.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìYou can get up now,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ she added, regally.

King Verence remained kneeling, about two inches above the actual ground.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìI crave a boon,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ he said urgently.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìHere, how did you get out of the castle?√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ said Granny.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìThe esteemed Nanny Ogg assisted me,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ said the king. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìI reasoned, if I am anchored to the stones of Lancre, then I can also go where the stones go. I am afraid I indulged in a little trickery to arrange matters. Currently I am haunting her apron.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìNot the first, either,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ said Granny, automatically.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìEsme!√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìAnd I beg you, Granny Weatherwax, to restore my son to the throne.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìRestore?√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìYou know what I mean. He is in good health?√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

Granny nodded. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìThe last time we Looked at him, he was eating an apple,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ she said.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìIt is his destiny to be King of Lancre!√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìYes, well. Destiny is tricky, you know,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ said Granny.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìYou will not help?√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

Granny looked wretched. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìIt√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s meddling, you see,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ she said. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìIt always goes wrong if you meddle in politics. Like, once you start, you can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t stop. Fundamental rule of magic, is that. You can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t go around messing with fundamental rules.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìYou√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re not going to help?√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìWell√¢‚Ç¨¬¶naturally, one day, when your lad is a bit older√¢‚Ç¨¬¶√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìWhere is he now?√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ said the king, coldly.

The witches avoided one another√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s faces.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìWe saw him safe out of the country, you see,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ said Granny awkwardly.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìVery good family,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ Nanny Ogg put in quickly.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìWhat kind of people?√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ said the king. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìNot commoners, I trust?√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìAbsolutely not,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ said Granny with considerable firmness as a vision of Vitoller floated across her imagination. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìNot common at all. Very uncommon. Er.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

Her eyes implored Magrat for help.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìThey were Thespians,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ said Magrat firmly, her voice radiating such approval that the king found himself nodding automatically.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìOh,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ he said. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìGood.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìWere they?√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ whispered Nanny Ogg. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìThey didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t look it.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìDon√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t show your ignorance, Gytha Ogg,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ sniffed Granny. She turned back to the ghost of the king. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìSorry about that, your majesty. It√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s just her showing off. She don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t even know where Thespia is.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìWherever it is, I hope that they know how to school a man in the arts of war,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ said Verence. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìI know Felmet. In ten years he√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ll be dug in here like a toad in a stone.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

The king looked from witch to witch. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìWhat kind of kingdom will he have to come back to? I hear what the kingdom is becoming, even now. Will you watch it change, over the years, become shoddy and mean?√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ The king√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s ghost faded.

His voice hung in the air, faint as a breeze.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìRemember, good sisters,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ he said, √¢‚Ç¨≈ìthe land and the king are one.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

And he vanished.

The embarrassed silence was broken by Magrat blowing her nose.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìOne what?√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ said Nanny Ogg.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìWe√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve got to do something,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ said Magrat, her voice choked with emotion. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìRules or no rules!√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìIt√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s very vexing,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ said Granny, quietly.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìYes, but what are you going to do?√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ she said.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìReflect on things,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ said Granny. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìThink about it all.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìYou√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve been thinking about it for a year,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ Magrat said.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìOne what? Are one what?√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ said Nanny Ogg.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìIt√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s no good just reacting,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ said Granny. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìYou√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve got to√¢‚Ç¨‚Äù√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

A cart came bouncing and rumbling along the track from Lancre. Granny ignored it.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ì√¢‚Ç¨‚Äùgive these things careful consideration.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìYou don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t know what to do, do you?√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ said Magrat.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìNonsense. I√¢‚Ç¨‚Äù√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìThere√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s a cart coming, Granny.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

Granny Weatherwax shrugged. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìWhat you youngsters don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t realize√¢‚Ç¨‚Äù√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ she began.

Witches never bothered with elementary road safety. Such traffic as there was on the roads of Lancre either went around them or, if this was not possible, waited until they moved out of the way. Granny Weatherwax had grown up knowing this for a fact; the only reason she didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t die knowing that it wasn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t was that Magrat, with rather better reflexes, dragged her into the ditch.

It was an interesting ditch. There were jiggling corkscrew things in it which were direct descendants of things which had been in the primordial soup of creation. Anyone who thought that ditchwater was dull could have spent an instructive half-hour in that ditch with a powerful microscope. It also had nettles in it, and now it had Granny Weatherwax.

She struggled up through the weeds, incoherent with rage, and rose from the ditch like Venus Anadyomene, only older and with more duckweed.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìT-t-t,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ she said, pointing a shaking finger at the disappearing cart.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìIt was young Nesheley from over Inkcap way,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ said Nanny Ogg, from a nearby bush. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìHis family were always a bit wild. Of course, his mother was a Whipple.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìHe ran us down!√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ said Granny.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìYou could have got out of the way,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ said Magrat.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìGet out of the way?√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ said Granny. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìWe√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re witches! People get out of our way!√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ She squelched onto the track, her finger still pointing at the distant cart. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìBy Hoki, I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ll make him wish he√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢d never been born√¢‚Ç¨‚Äù√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìHe was quite a big baby, I recall,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ said the bush. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìHis mother had a terrible time.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìIt√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s never happened to me before, ever,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ said Granny, still twanging like a bowstring. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìI√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ll teach him to run us down as though, as though, as though we was ordinary people!√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìHe already knows,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ said Magrat. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìJust help me get Nanny out of this bush, will you?√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìI√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ll turn his√¢‚Ç¨‚Äù√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìPeople haven√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t got any respect anymore, that√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s what it is,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ said Nanny, as Magrat helped her with the thorns. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìIt√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s all due to the king being one, I expect.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìWe√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re witches!√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ screamed Granny, turning her face toward the sky and shaking her fists.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìYes, yes,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ said Magrat. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìThe harmonious balance of the universe and everything. I think Nanny√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s a bit tired.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìWhat√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve I been doing all this time?√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ said Granny, with a rhetorical flourish that would have made even Vitoller gasp.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìNot a lot,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ said Magrat.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìLaughed at! Laughed at! On my own roads! In my own country!√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ screamed Granny. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìThat just about does it! I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m not taking ten more years of this! I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m not taking another day of it!√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

The trees around her began to sway and the dust from the road sprang up into writhing shapes that tried to swirl out of her way. Granny Weatherwax extended one long arm and at the end of it unfolded one long finger and from the tip of its curving nail there was a brief flare of octarine fire.

Half a mile down the track all four wheels fell off the cart at once.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìLock up a witch, would he?√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ Granny shouted at the trees.

Nanny struggled to her feet.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìWe√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢d better grab her,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ she whispered to Magrat. The two of them leapt at Granny and forced her arms down to her sides.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìI√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ll bloody well show him what a witch could do!√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ she yelled.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìYes, yes, very good, very good,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ said Nanny. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìOnly perhaps not just now and not just like this, eh?√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìWyrd sisters, indeed!√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ Granny yelled. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìI√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ll make his√¢‚Ç¨‚Äù√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìHold her a minute, Magrat,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ said Nanny Ogg, and rolled up her sleeve.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìIt can be like this with the highly-trained ones,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ she said, and brought her plam around in a slap that lifted both witches off their feet. On such a flat, final note the universe might have ended.

At the conclusion of the breathless silence which followed Granny Weatherwax said, √¢‚Ç¨≈ìThank you.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

She adjusted her dress with some show of dignity, and added, √¢‚Ç¨≈ìBut I meant it. We√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ll meet tonight at the stone and do what must be done. Ahem.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

She reset the pins in her hat and set off unsteadily in the direction of her cottage.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìWhatever happened to the rule about not meddling in politics?√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ said Magrat, watching her retreating back.

Nanny Ogg massaged some life back into her fingers.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìBy Hoki, that woman√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s got a jaw like an anvil,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ she said. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìWhat was that?√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìI said, what about this rule about not meddling?√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ said Magrat.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìAh,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ said Nanny. She took the girl√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s arm. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìThe thing is,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ she explained, √¢‚Ç¨≈ìas you progress in the Craft, you√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ll learn there is another rule. Esme√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s obeyed it all her life.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìAnd what√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s that?√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìWhen you break rules, break √¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢em good and hard,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ said Nanny, and grinned a set of gums that were more menacing than teeth.∆E
