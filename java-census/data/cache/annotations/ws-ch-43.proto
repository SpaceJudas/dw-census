©õ√¢‚Ç¨≈ìWhat?√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ said the guard.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìI SAID,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ said Magrat, √¢‚Ç¨≈ìI√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve come to sell my lovely apples. Don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t you listen?√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìThere√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s not a sale on, is there?√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ The guard was extremely nervous since his colleague had been taken off to the infirmary. He hadn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t taken the job in order to deal with this sort of thing.

It dawned on him.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìYou√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re not a witch, are you?√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ he said, fumbling awkwardly with his pike.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìOf course not. Do I look like one?√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

The guard looked at her occult bangles, her lined cloak, her trembling hands and her face. The face was particularly worrying. Magrat had used a lot of powder to make her face pale and interesting. It combined with the lavishly applied mascara to give the guard the impression that he was looking at two flies that had crashed into a sugar bowl. He found his fingers wanted to make a sign to ward off the evil eyeshadow.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìRight,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ he said uncertainly. His mind was grinding through the problem. She was a witch. Just lately there√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢d been a lot of gossip about witches being bad for your health. He√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢d been told not to let witches pass, but no one had said anything about apple sellers. Apple sellers were not a problem. It was witches that were the problem. She√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢d said she was an apple seller and he wasn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t about to doubt a witch√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s word.

Feeling happy with this application of logic, he stood to one side and gave an expansive wave.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìPass, apple seller,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ he said.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìThank you,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ said Magrat sweetly. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìWould you like an apple?√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìNo, thanks. I haven√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t finished the one the other witch gave me.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ His eyes rolled. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìNot a witch. Not a witch, an apple seller. An apple seller. She ought to know.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìHow long ago was this?√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìJust a few minutes√¢‚Ç¨¬¶√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

Granny Weatherwax was not lost. She wasn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t the kind of person who ever became lost. It was just that, at the moment, while she knew exactly where SHE was, she didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t know the position of anywhere else. Currently she had arrived in the kitchens again, precipitating a breakdown in the cook, who was trying to roast some celery. The fact that several people had tried to buy apples from her wasn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t improving her temper.

Magrat found her way to the Great Hall, empty and deserted at this time of day except for a couple of guards who were playing dice. They wore the tabards of Felmet√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s own personal bodyguard, and stopped their game as soon as she appeared.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìWell, well,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ said one, leering. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìCome to keep us company, have you, my pretty.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìI was looking for the dungeons,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ said Magrat, to whom the words √¢‚Ç¨≈ìsexual harassment√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ were a mere collection of syllables.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìJust fancy,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ said one of the guards, winking at the other. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìI reckon we can help you there.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ They got up and stood either side of her; she was aware of two chins you could strike matches on and an overpowering smell of stale beer. Frantic signals from outlying portions of her mind began to break down her iron-hard conviction that bad things only happened to bad people.

They escorted her down several flights of steps into a maze of dank, arched passageways as she sought hurriedly for some polite way of disengaging herself.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìI should warn you,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ she said, √¢‚Ç¨≈ìI am not, as I may appear, a simple apple seller.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìFancy that.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìI am, in fact, a witch.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

This did not make the impression she had hoped. The guards exchanged glances.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìFair enough,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ said one. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìI√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve always wondered what it was like to kiss a witch. Around here they do say you gets turned into a frog.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

The other guard nudged him. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìI reckon, then,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ he said, in the slow, ripe tones of one who thinks that what he is about to say next is going to be incredibly funny, √¢‚Ç¨≈ìyou kissed one years ago.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

The brief guffaw was suddenly interrupted when Magrat was flung against the wall and treated to a close up view of the guard√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s nostrils.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìNow listen to me, sweetheart,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ he said. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìYou ain√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t the first witch we√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve had down here, if witch you be, but you could be lucky and walk out again. If you are nice to us, d√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢you see?√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

There was a shrill, short scream from somewhere nearby.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìThat, you see,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ said the guard, √¢‚Ç¨≈ìwas a witch having it the hard way. You could do us all a favor, see? Lucky you met us, really.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

His questing hand stopped its wandering. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìWhat√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s this?√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ he said to Magrat√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s pale face. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìA knife? A knife? I reckon we√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve got to take that very seriously, don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t you, Hron?√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìYou got to tie her hands and gag her,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ said Hron hurriedly. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìThey can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t do no magic if they can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t speak or wave their hands about√¢‚Ç¨¬¶√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìYou can take your hands off her!√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

All three stared down the passage at the Fool. He was jingling with rage.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìLet her go this minute!√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ he shouted. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìOr I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ll report you!√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìOh, you√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ll report us, will you?√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ said Hron. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìAnd will anyone listen to you, you earwax-colored little twerp?√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìThis is a witch we have here,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ said the other guard. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìSo you can go and tinkle somewhere else.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ He turned back to Magrat. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìI like a girl with spirit,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ he said, incorrectly as it turned out.

The Fool advanced with the bravery of the terminally angry.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìI told you to let her go,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ he repeated.

Hron drew his sword and winked at his companion.

Magrat struck. It was an unplanned, instinctive blow, its stopping power considerably enhanced by the weight of rings and bangles; her arm whirred around in an arc that connected with her captor√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s jaw and spun him twice before he folded up in a heap with a quiet little sigh, and incidentally with several symbols of occult significance enbossed on his cheek.

Hron gaped at him, and then looked at Magrat. He raised his sword at about the same moment that the Fool cannoned into him, and the two men went down in a struggling heap. Like most small men the Fool relied on the initial mad rush to secure an advantage and was at a loss for a follow-through, and it would probably have gone hard with him if Hron hadn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t suddenly become aware that a breadknife was pressed to his neck.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìLet go of him,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ said Magrat, pushing her hair out of her eyes.

He stiffened. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìYou√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re wondering whether I really would cut your throat,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ panted Magrat. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìI don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t know either. Think of the fun we could have together, finding out.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

She reached down with her other hand and hauled the Fool to his feet by his collar.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìWhere did that scream come from?√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ she said, without taking her eyes off the guard.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìIt was down this way. They√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve got her in the torture dungeon and I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t like it, it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s going too far, and I couldn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t get in and I couldn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t get in and I came to look for someone√¢‚Ç¨‚Äù√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìWell, you√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve found me,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ said Magrat.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìYou,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ she said to Hron, √¢‚Ç¨≈ìwill stay here. Or run away, for all I care. But you won√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t follow us.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

He nodded, and stared after them as they hurried down the passage. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìThe door√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s locked,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ said the Fool. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìThere√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s all sorts of noises, but the door√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s locked.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìWell, it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s a dungeon, isn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t it?√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìThey√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re not supposed to lock from the inside!√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

It was, indeed, unbudgeable. Silence came from the other side√¢‚Ç¨‚Äùa busy, thick silence that crawled through the cracks and spilled out into the passage, a kind of silence that is worse than screams.

The Fool hopped from one foot to the other as Magrat explored the door√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s rough surface.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìAre you really a witch?√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ he said. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìThey said you were a witch, are you really? You don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t look like a witch, you look very, that is√¢‚Ç¨¬¶√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ He blushed. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìNot like a, you know, crone at all, but absolutely beautiful√¢‚Ç¨¬¶√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ His voice trailed into silence√¢‚Ç¨¬¶

I am totally in control of the situation, Magrat told herself. I never thought I would be, but I am thinking absolutely clearly.

And she realized, in an absolutely clear way, that her padding had slipped down to her waist, her head felt as though a family of unhygienic birds had been nesting in it, and her eyeshadow had not so much run as sprinted. Her dress was torn in several places, her legs were scratched, her arms were bruised, and for some reason she felt on top of the world.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìI think you√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢d better stand back, Verence,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ she said. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìI√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m not sure how this is going to work.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

There was a sharp intake of breath.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìHow did you know my name?√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

Magrat sized up the door. The oak was old, centuries old, but she could sense just a little sap under a surface varnished by the years into something that was nearly as tough as stone. Normally what she had in mind would require a day√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s planning and a bagful of exotic ingredients. At least, so she√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢d always believed. Now she was prepared to doubt it. If you could conjure demons out of washtubs, you could do anything.

She became aware that the Fool had spoken.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìOh, I expect I heard it somewhere,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ she said vaguely.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìI shouldn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t think so, I never use it,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ said the Fool. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìI mean, it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s not a popular name with the duke. It was me mam, you see. They like to name you after kings, I suppose. My grandad said I had no business having a name like that and he said I shouldn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t go around√¢‚Ç¨‚Äù√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

Magrat nodded. She was looking around the dank tunnel with a professional√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s eye.

It wasn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t a promising place. The old oak planks had been down here in the darkness all these years, away from the clock of the seasons√¢‚Ç¨¬¶

On the other hand√¢‚Ç¨¬¶Granny had said that somehow all trees were one tree, or something like that. Magrat thought she understood it, although she didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t know exactly what it meant. And it was springtime up there. The ghost of life that still lived in the wood must know that. Or if it had forgotten, it must be told.

She put her palms flat on the door again and shut her eyes, tried to think her way out through the stone, out of the castle, and into the thin, black soil of the mountains, into the air, into the sunlight√¢‚Ç¨¬¶

The Fool was merely aware that Magrat was standing very still. Then her hair stood out from her head, gently, and there was a smell of leaf mold.

And then, without warning, the hammer that can drive a marshmallow-soft toadstool through six inches of solid pavement or an eel across a thousand miles of hostile ocean to a particular pond in an upland field, struck up through her and into the door.

She stepped back carefully, her mind stunned, fighting against a desperate urge to bury her toes into the rock and put forth leaves. The Fool caught her, and the shock nearly knocked him over.

Magrat sagged against the faintly jingling body, and felt triumphant. She had done it! And with no artificial aids! If only the others could have seen this√¢‚Ç¨¬¶

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìDon√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t go near it,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ she mumbled. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìI think I gave it rather√¢‚Ç¨¬¶a lot.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ The Fool was still holding her toastrack body in his arms and was too overcome to utter a word, but she still got a reply.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìI reckon you did,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ said Granny Weatherwax, stepping out of the shadows. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìI never would have thought of it myself.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

Magrat peered at her.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìYou√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve been here all the time?√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìJust a few minutes.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ Granny glanced at the door. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìGood technique,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ she said, √¢‚Ç¨≈ìbut it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s old wood. Been in a fire, too, I reckon. Lot of iron nails and stuff in there. Can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t see it working, I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢d have tried the stones if it was me, but√¢‚Ç¨‚Äù√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

She was interrupted by a soft √¢‚Ç¨≈ìpop.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

There was another, and then a whole series of them together, like a shower of meringues.

Behind her, very gently, the door was breaking into leaf.

Granny stared at it for a few seconds, and then met Magrat√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s terrified gaze.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìRun!√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ she yelled.

They grabbed the Fool and scurried into the shelter of a convenient buttress.

The door gave a warning creak. Several of its planks twisted in vegetable agony and there was a shower of rock splinters when nails were expelled like thorns from a wound, ricocheting off the stonework. The Fool ducked as part of the lock whirred over his head and smashed into the opposite wall.

The lower parts of the planks extended questing white roots, which slithered across the damp stone to the nearest crack and began to auger in. Knotholes bulged, burst and thrust out branches which hit the stones of the doorway and tumbled them aside. And all the time there was a low groan, the sound of the cells of the wood trying to contain the surge of raw life pounding through them.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìIf it had been me,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ said Granny Weatherwax, as part of the ceiling caved in further along the passage, √¢‚Ç¨≈ìI wouldn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t have done it like that. Not that I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m objecting, mind you,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ she said, as Magrat opened her mouth. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìIt√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s a reasonable job. I think you might have overdone it a bit, that√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s all.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìExcuse me,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ said the Fool.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìI can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t do rocks,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ said Magrat.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìWell, no, rocks is an acquired taste√¢‚Ç¨‚Äù√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìExcuse me.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

The two witches stared at him, and he backed away.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìWeren√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t you supposed to be rescuing someone?√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ he said.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìOh,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ said Granny. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìYes. Come on, Magrat. We√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢d better see what she√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s been getting up to.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìThere were screams,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ said the Fool, who couldn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t help feeling they weren√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t taking things seriously enough.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìI daresay,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ said Granny, pushing him aside and stepping over a writhing taproot. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìIf anyone locked me in a dungeon, there√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢d be screams.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

There was a lot of dust inside the dungeon, and by the nimbus of light around its one torch Magrat could dimly make out two figures cowering in the furthest corner. Most of the furniture had been overturned and scattered across the floor; it didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t look as though any of it had been designed to be the last word in comfort. Nanny Ogg was sitting quite calmly in what appeared to be a sort of stocks.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìTook your time,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ she observed. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìLet me out of this, will you? I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m getting cramp.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

And there was the dagger.

It spun gently in the middle of the room, glinting when the turning blade caught the light.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìMy own dagger!√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ said the ghost of the king, in a voice only the witches could hear. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìAll this time and I never knew it! My own dagger! They bloody well did me in with my own bloody knife!√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

He took another step toward the royal couple, waving the dagger. A faint gurgle escaped from the lips of the duke, glad to be out of there.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìHe√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s doing well, isn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t he,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ said Nanny, as Magrat helped her out of her prison.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìIsn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t that the old king? Can they see him?√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìShouldn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t think so.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

King Verence staggered slightly under the weight. He was too old for such poltergeist activity; you had to be an adolescent for this√¢‚Ç¨¬¶

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìLet me just get a grip on this thing,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ he said. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìOh, damn√¢‚Ç¨¬¶√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

The knife dropped from the ghost√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s tenuous grasp and clattered to the floor. Granny Weatherwax stepped forward smartly and put her foot on it.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìThe dead shouldn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t kill the living,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ she said. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìIt could be a dangerous wossname, precedent. We√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢d all be outnumbered, for one thing.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

The duchess surfaced from her terror first. There had been knives swooping through the air and exploding doors, and now these women were defying her in her own dungeons. She couldn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t be sure how she was supposed to react to the supernatural items, but she had very firm ideas about how she should tackle the last one.

Her mouth opened like the gateway to a red hell. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìGuards!√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ she yelled, and spotted the Fool hovering near the door. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìFool! Fetch the guards!√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìThey√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re busy. We were just leaving,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ said Granny. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìWhich one of you is the duke?√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

Felmet stared pink-eyed up at her from his half-crouch in the corner. A thin dribble of saliva escaped from the corner of his mouth, and he giggled.

Granny looked closer. In the center of those streaming eyes something else looked back at her.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìI√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m going to give you no cause,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ she said quietly. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìBut it would be better for you if you left this country. Abdicate, or whatever.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìIn favor of whom?√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ said the duchess icily. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìA witch?√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìI won√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ said the duke.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìWhat did you say?√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

The duke pulled himself upright, brushed some of the dust off his clothes, and looked Granny full in the face. The coldness in the center of his eyes was larger.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìI said I won√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ he said. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìDo you think a bit of simple conjuring would frighten me? I am the king by right of conquest, and you cannot change it. It is as simple as that, witch.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

He moved closer.

Granny stared at him. She hadn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t faced anything like this before. The man was clearly mad, but at the heart of his madness was a dreadful cold sanity, a core of pure interstellar ice in the center of the furnace. She√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢d thought him weak under a thin shell of strength, but it went a lot further than that. Somewhere deep inside his mind, somewhere beyond the event horizon of rationality, the sheer pressure of insanity had hammered his madness into something harder than diamond.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìIf you defeat me by magic, magic will rule,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ said the duke. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìAnd you can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t do it. And any king raised with your help would be under your power. Hag-ridden, I might say. That which magic rules, magic destroys. It would destroy you, too. You know it. Ha. Ha.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

Granny√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s knuckles whitened as he moved closer.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìYou could strike me down,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ he said. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìAnd perhaps you could find someone to replace me. But he would have to be a fool indeed, because he would know he was under your evil eye, and if he mispleased you, why, his life would be instantly forfeit. You could protest all you wished, but he√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢d know he ruled with your permission. And that would make him no king at all. Is this not true?√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

Granny looked away. The other witches hung back, ready to duck.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìI said, is this not true?√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìYes,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ said Granny. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìIt is true√¢‚Ç¨¬¶√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìYes.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ì√¢‚Ç¨¬¶but there is one who could defeat you,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ said Granny slowly.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìThe child? Let him come when he is grown. A young man with a sword, seeking his destiny.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ The duke sneered. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìVery romantic. But I have many years to prepare. Let him try.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

Beside him King Verence√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s fist smashed through the air and quite failed to connect.

The duke leaned closer until his nose was an inch from Granny√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s face.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìGet back to your cauldrons, wyrd sisters,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ he said softly.‹
