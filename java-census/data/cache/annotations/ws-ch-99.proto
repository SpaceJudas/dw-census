økRamtop rain has a curiously penetrative quality which makes ordinary rain seem almost arid. It poured in torrents over the castle roofs, and somehow seemed to go right through the tiles and fill the Great Hall with a warm, uncomfortable moistness.

The hall was crowded with half the population of Lancre. Outside, the rushing of the rain even drowned out the distant roar of the river. It soaked the stage. The colors ran and mingled in the painted backdrop, and one of the curtains sagged away from its rail and flapped sadly into a puddle.

Inside, Granny Weatherwax finished speaking.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìYou forgot about the crown,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ whispered Nanny Ogg.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìAh,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ said Granny. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìYes, the crown. It√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s on his head, d√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢you see? We hid it among the crowns when the actors left, the reason being, no one would look for it there. See how it fits him so perfectly.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

It was a tribute to Granny√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s extraordinary powers of persuasion that everyone did see how perfectly it fitted Tomjon. In fact the only one who didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t was Tomjon himself, who was aware that it was only his ears that were stopping it becoming a necklace.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìImagine the sensation when he put it on for the first time,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ she went on. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìI expect there was an eldritch tingling sensation.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìActually, it felt rather√¢‚Ç¨‚Äù√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ Tomjon began, but no one was listening to him. He shrugged and leaned over to Hwel, who was still scribbling busily.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìDoes eldritch mean uncomfortable?√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ he hissed.

The dwarf looked at him with unfocused eyes.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìWhat?√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìI said, does eldritch mean uncomfortable?√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìEh? Oh. No. No, I shouldn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t think so.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìWhat does it mean then?√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìDunno. Oblong, I think.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ Hwel√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s glance returned to his scrawls as though magnetized. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìCan you remember what he said after all those tomorrows? I didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t catch the bit after that√¢‚Ç¨¬¶√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìAnd there wasn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t any need for you to tell everyone I was√¢‚Ç¨‚Äùadopted,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ said Tomjon.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìThat√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s how it was, you see,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ said the dwarf vaguely. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìBest to be honest about these things. Now then, did he actually stab her, or just accuse her?√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìI don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t want to be a king!√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ Tomjon whispered hoarsely. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìEveryone says I take after dad!√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìFunny thing, all this taking after people,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ said the dwarf vaguely. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìI mean, if I took after my dad, I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢d be a hundred feet underground digging rocks, whereas√¢‚Ç¨‚Äù√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ His voice died away. He stared at the nib of his pen as though it held an incredible fascination.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìWhereas what?√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìEh?√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìAren√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t you even listening?√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìI knew it was wrong when I wrote it, I knew it was the wrong way round√¢‚Ç¨¬¶What? Oh, yes. Be a king. It√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s a good job. It seems there√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s a lot of competition, at any rate. I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m very happy for you. Once you√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re a king, you can do anything you want.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

Tomjon looked at the faces of the Lancre worthies around the table. They had a keen, calculating look, like the audience at a fatstock show. They were weighing him up. It crept upon him in a cold and clammy way that once he was king, he could do anything he wanted. Provided that what he wanted to do was be king.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìYou could build your own theater,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ said Hwel, his eyes lighting up for a moment. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìWith as many trapdoors as you wanted, and magnificent costumes. You could act in a new play every night. I mean, it would make the Dysk look like a shed.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìWho would come to see me?√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ said Tomjon, sagging in his seat.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìEveryone.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìWhat, every night?√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìYou could order them to,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ said Hwel, without looking up.

I knew he was going to say that, Tomjon thought. He can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t really mean it, he added charitably. He√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s got his play. He doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t really exist in this world, not right now at the moment.

He took off the crown and turned it over and over in his hands. There wasn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t much metal in it, but it felt heavy. He wondered how heavy it would get if you wore it all the time.

At the head of the table was an empty chair containing, he had been assured, the ghost of his real father. It would have been nice to report that he had experienced anything more, when being introduced to it, than an icy sensation and a buzzing in the ears.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìI suppose I could help father pay off on the Dysk,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ he said.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìThat would be nice, yes,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ said Hwel.

He spun the crown in his fingers and listened glumly to the talk flowing back and forth over his head.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìFifteen years?√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ said the Mayor of Lancre.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìWe had to,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ said Granny Weatherwax.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìI thought the baker was a bit early last week.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìNo, no,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ said the witch impatiently. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìIt doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t work like that. No one√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s lost anything.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìAccording to my figuring,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ said the man who doubled as Lancre√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s beadle, town clerk and grave-digger, √¢‚Ç¨≈ìwe√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve all lost fifteen years.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìNo, we√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve all gained them,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ said the mayor. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìIt stands to reason. Time√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s like this sort of wiggly road, see, but we took a short cut across the fields.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìNot at all,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ said the clerk, sliding a sheet of paper across the table. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìLook here√¢‚Ç¨¬¶√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

Tomjon let the waters of debate close over him again.

Everyone wanted him to be king. No one thought twice about what he wanted. His views didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t count.

Yes, that was it. No one wanted him to be king, not precisely him. He just happened to be convenient.

Gold does not tarnish, at least physically, but Tomjon felt that the thin band of metal in his hands had an unpleasant depth to its luster. It had sat on too many troubled heads. If you held it to your ear, you could hear the screams.

He became aware of someone else looking at him, their gaze playing across his face like a blowlamp on a lolly. He looked up.

It was the third witch, the young√¢‚Ç¨¬¶the youngest one, with the intense expression and the hedgerow hairstyle. Sitting next to old Fool as though she owned a controlling interest.

It wasn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t his face she was examining. It was his features. Her eyeballs were tracking him from nape to nose like a pair of calipers. He gave her a little brave smile, which she ignored. Just like everyone else, he thought.

Only the Fool noticed him, and returned the smile with an apologetic grin and a tiny conspiratorial wave of the fingers that said: √¢‚Ç¨≈ìWhat are we doing here, two sensible people like us?√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ The woman was looking at him again, turning her head this way and that and narrowing her eyes. She kept glancing at Fool and back to Tomjon. Then she turned to the oldest witch, the only person in the entire hot, damp room who seemed to have acquired a mug of beer, and whispered in her ear.

The two started a spirited, whispered conversation. It was, thought Tomjon, a particularly feminine way of talking. It normally took place on doorsteps, with all the participants standing with their arms folded and, if anyone was so ungracious as to walk past, they√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢d stop abruptly and watch them in silence until they were safely out of earshot.

He became aware that Granny Weatherwax had stopped talking, and that the entire hall was staring at him expectantly.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìHallo?√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ he said.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìIt might be a good idea to hold the coronation tomorrow,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ said Granny. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìIt√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s not good for a kingdom to be without a ruler. It doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t like it.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

She stood up, pushed back her chair, and came and took Tomjon√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s hand. He followed her unprotestingly across the flagstones and up the steps to the throne, where she put her hands on his shoulders and pressed him gently down onto the threadbare red plush cushions.

There was a scraping of benches and chairs. He looked around in panic.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìWhat√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s happening now?√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ he said.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìDon√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t worry,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ said Granny firmly. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìEveryone wants to come and swear loyalty to you. You just nod graciously and ask everyone what they do and if they enjoy it. Oh, and you√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢d better give them the crown back.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

Tomjon removed it quickly.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìWhy?√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ he said.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìThey want to present it to you.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìBut I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve already got it!√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ said Tomjon desperately.

Granny gave a patient sigh.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìOnly in the wossname, real sense,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ she said. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìThis is more ceremonial.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìYou mean unreal?√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìYes,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ said Granny. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìBut much more important.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

Tomjon gripped the arms of the throne.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìFetch me Hwel,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ he said.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìNo, you must do it like that. It√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s precedent, you see, first you meet the√¢‚Ç¨‚Äù√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìI said, fetch me the dwarf. Didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t you hear me, woman?√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ This time Tomjon got the spin and pitch of his voice just right, but Granny rallied magnificently.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìI don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t think you quite realize who you are talking to, young man,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ she said.

Tomjon half rose in his seat. He had played a great many kings, and most of them weren√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t the kind of kings who shook hands graciously and asked people whether they enjoyed their work. They were far more the type of kings who got people to charge into battle at five o√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢clock on a freezing morning and still managed to persuade them that this was better than being in bed. He summoned them all, and treated Granny Weatherwax to a blast of royal hauteur, pride and arrogance.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìWe thought we were talking to a subject,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ he said. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìNow do as we say!√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

Granny√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s face was immobile for several seconds as she worked out what to do next. Then she smiled to herself, said lightly, √¢‚Ç¨≈ìAs you wish,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ and went and dislodged Hwel, who was still writing.

The dwarf gave a stiff bow.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìNone of that,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ snapped Tomjon. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìWhat do I do next?√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìI don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t know. Do you want me to write an acceptance speech?√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìI told you. I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t want to be king!√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìCould be a problem with an acceptance speech, then,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ the dwarf agreed. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìHave you really thought about this? Being king is a great role.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìBut it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s the only one you get to play!√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìHmm. Well, just tell them √¢‚Ç¨Àúno,√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ then.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìJust like that? Will it work?√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìIt√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s got to be worth a try.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

A group of Lancre dignitaries were approaching with the crown on a cushion. They wore expressions of constipated respect coupled with just a hint of self-satisfaction. They carried the crown as if it was a Present for a Good Boy.

The Mayor of Lancre coughed behind his hand.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìA proper coronation will take some time to arrange,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ he began, √¢‚Ç¨≈ìbut we would like√¢‚Ç¨‚Äù√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìNo,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ said Tomjon.

The mayor hesitated. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìPardon?√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ he said.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìI won√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t accept it.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

The mayor hesitated again. His lips moved and his eyes glazed slightly. He felt that he had got lost somewhere, and decided it would be best to start again.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìA proper coronation will take√¢‚Ç¨‚Äù√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ he ventured.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìIt won√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ said Tomjon. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìI will not be king.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

The mayor was mouthing like a carp.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìHwel?√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ said Tomjon desperately. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìYou√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re good with words.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìThe problem we√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve got here,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ said the dwarf, √¢‚Ç¨≈ìis that √¢‚Ç¨Àúno√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ is apparently not among the options when you are offered a crown. I think he could cope with √¢‚Ç¨Àúmaybe.√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

Tomjon stood up, and grabbed the crown. He held it above his head like a tambourine.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìListen to me, all of you,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ he said. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìI thank you for your offer, it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s a great honor. But I can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t accept it. I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve worn more crowns than you can count, and the only kingdom I know how to rule has got curtains in front of it. I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m sorry.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

Dead silence greeted this. They did not appear to have been the right words.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìAnother problem,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ said Hwel conversationally, √¢‚Ç¨≈ìis that you don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t actually have a choice. You are the king, you see. It√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s a job you are lined up for when you√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re born.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìI√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢d be no good at it!√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìThat doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t matter. A king isn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t something you√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re good at, it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s something you are.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìYou can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t leave me here! There√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s nothing but forests!√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

Tomjon felt the suffocating cold sensation again, and the slow buzzing in his ears. For a moment he thought he saw, faint as a mist, a tall sad man in front of him, stretching out a hand in supplication.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìI√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m sorry,√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ he whispered. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìI really am.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

Through the fading shape he saw the witches, watching him intently.

Beside him Hwel said, √¢‚Ç¨≈ìThe only chance you√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢d have is if there was another heir. You don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t remember any brothers and sisters, do you?√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìI don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t remember anyone! Hwel, I√¢‚Ç¨‚Äù√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ

There was another ferocious argument among the witches. And then Magrat was striding, striding across the hall, moving like a tidal wave, moving like a rush of blood to the head, shaking off Granny Weatherwax√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s restraining hand, bearing down on the throne like a piston, and dragging the Fool behind her.ã(
